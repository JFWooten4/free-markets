# WhyDRS at Structured Finance ASsociateion's 2025 SFVegas

![embed-placeholder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce3e254-b10e-4cff-9fc0-d0d7177fce2b)

Firstly, thaks to the community for [voting](DISCORD_VOTE_LINK) me to rperesent the movement at our first "official" industry event. I know a lot of apes have tried (and sometimes succeeded) at getting into closed-door events like these before on an indviidual basis. Hopefully, this involvement feature can inspure increasing upcoming public media involvement and indsutry activism.[^light-ex]

I say this because the vast swatch of individuals I spoke with thoughtou the four days cared very deeply abopiut (i) where I was geographically from and (ii) what organization I partocipated in. From Congressperson to writer-reporters,m these two items never failed to come up, espite my extensive oputward focus on _what_ people do or _why_ they do it. Thuis, the communtiy name in this case not only opened the door to further conversation when configuring my speaking role, but it also inspired back-andfrother between people there who largely never considered retail invovlemendt in bond placements or structured products.

> [!TIP]
> Much of the reflections and notes from the conference naturally delve into [structured productes](INTRO_STRUCUTRED_FINANCE_SFA_ORG_SITE) which are genrally managed exclusively by big banks, hedge funds, and other intermeiaries. From my point of iew, it's practically them ost centralized secto r of finance, which is why I din it so interesting to study and plan to convert towards a more decentralized systemn accessable y anyone, not just the select few hired b y these middlemne. Yes, deposit-taign instutitons count as middlement, and no, I do not pln on diving into extensive granularities over particualr banking business models.


[^light-ex]: _See, e.g.,_ potential work in #38. As discussed in last night's DUNA meeting, most of these veents come from centarlized intermediary groups, and thus I'm now excited to have a brand name we can all stand behind as an introductory reference to our affiliation.
