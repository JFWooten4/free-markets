# WhyDRS at Structured Finance ASsociateion's 2025 SFVegas

![embed-placeholder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce3e254-b10e-4cff-9fc0-d0d7177fce2b)

Firstly, thaks to the community for [voting](DISCORD_VOTE_LINK) me to rperesent the movement at our first "official" industry event. I know a lot of apes have tried (and sometimes succeeded) at getting into closed-door events like these before on an indviidual basis. Hopefully, this involvement feature can inspure increasing upcoming public media involvement and indsutry activism.[^light-ex]

I say this because the vast swatch of individuals I spoke with thoughtou the four days cared very deeply abopiut (i) where I was geographically from and (ii) what organization I partocipated in. From Congressperson to writer-reporters,m these two items never failed to come up, espite my extensive oputward focus on _what_ people do or _why_ they do it. Thuis, the communtiy name in this case not only opened the door to further conversation when configuring my speaking role, but it also inspired back-andfrother between people there who largely never considered retail invovlemendt in bond placements or structured products.

> [!TIP]
> Much of the reflections and notes from the conference naturally delve into [structured productes](INTRO_STRUCUTRED_FINANCE_SFA_ORG_SITE) which are genrally managed exclusively by big banks, hedge funds, and other intermeiaries. From my point of iew, it's practically them ost centralized secto r of finance, which is why I din it so interesting to study and plan to convert towards a more decentralized systemn accessable y anyone, not just the select few hired b y these middlemne. Yes, deposit-taign instutitons count as middlement, and no, I do not pln on diving into extensive granularities over particualr banking business models.


[^light-ex]: _See, e.g.,_ potential work in #38. As discussed in last night's DUNA meeting, most of these veents come from centarlized intermediary groups, and thus I'm now excited to have a brand name we can all stand behind as an introductory reference to our affiliation.


## Topics from Sunbday

As per the present placeholder above, there arent' any videos of event panels just yet.[^back-rroom] Thus, my notes fcome from the panels I could attend, given the agenda[^agenda-url] often had multiple speakers discussing imporatn topics at the same time. And, of course, miscelanrous conversations from cold intros will never have canotical web refernces.


[^back-rroom]: And there certainly aren't any (authorized) reo rdings of behind-the-door conversations around the venue at large. Notably, only a third of the space for the meetup was allocated for public discussions, panels, or headlining forums. The rest was privately-sponsored closed-door rooms requiring specific permission and check--in from one of the many intermediaryies sponsoring the event. Industry particpiants I knew from years prior frequented these rooms and the sacrency of their walls because they housed "top executives and decision-makers" at some of the largest businesses in the sector. 

[^agenda-url]: In searhcing for cittaitons for the enxt footnote, I went to review the agenda of speakers, topics, and events over the course of the event. I had this webpage up on m phone during the proceedings to organize my activity. However, the agenda copmeltely dissapreared off the web, as has happened for every other year I've participated. When looking at Archive.org nsapshots of the page, they too are compeltely blank. my bad in not capturing an offline copy of the information beforehand; have any other comunity memebrs screenshotted this basic scheudule?


### Student-Loan ABS Outlooks

Since studet loans are the assets which back a large sector of secutirized products, recent activity from DOGE quikly emmerged. In this panel, it was generally clear that Musk wants less federal grant money and more private student loans. FInanical aid should stay in the private sector according to their interpretation of Federal intetions.

Naturlaly, this development fuelds the growth of their  business since the industry exists by bundking together groups of student laons into investment vehicles with practically-garunteed paytment schedules.[^src-ing-sls] Ignoringin momentarily the quadaries of student laons, the panelsts largely sold the asset class as a steadfast vehicle. However, I viewed this as a vehicle avaliable only to a select few, as one panelt told a story about raising hundreds of millions of dollars from twelve investors.

These middlemen-instutiions singelhandedly (albeit together) funded an education-bond securitization represetinging countless students who needed an extra few bucks to afford rising college investments so often deemed necessary by central employers. Aside from being fenerally non-defaultable, this offering was deemed "less risky" by the indsutry given its extensive diversification amongst (georgraphical) students. In another new product, a paenslist talked about how they sold a riskier pool of "smaller" subscriptions from only eight investors.[^8-inv-ba]

Lastly, the paneltists colectively ocmmented onthe need to educate consumers about the operations of private student loans. Theyt focused particualrly on the Federal pause on loan payments under the CARES Act, a crisis relief platfomr not extended to private student loans. It was my interperations of their general conversation and body language here that they saw nonpayment spike amidst "consumer confusion" (verabtim) over their payment policies, given the big banks offered no such relief.


[^src-ing-sls]: Unfortunatyyl, i do not have access to the proproiretary investment platyfomr offering these assets. Accordingly, I cannot analyze or reference specificic offerings composed of central loans. In extended discussion after the panel, I came to itnerperet that only "qualified" institutions (read: not [Qualified](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/2001/12/defining-term-qualified-purchaser-under-securities-act-1933)) can viw offering details or bid on loan pools. Because why would we let investors like us access diversified, proven investment vehicles?

[^8-inv-ba]: This offering was notable  ot me because the panelist sounded quite dismissive and unserous about the deal because it was "only" sparingly inthe realy of eight figures. Tpo me, they made it sound like an act of charity to accept a cehck under nine figures and certainyl anythign below 50 million dollars. They also compalainied that their rerresented parent firm had to pay higher yields on these assets solely due to the tighter concentration of only a thousand more-or-less students.

Steve Kornacki newscaster: on about a decade of Trump in policy
