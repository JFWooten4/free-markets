#  Decentalized marketing - Is it POssible and HOw SHould we APproach it?


HEllo hi!@ I am making an effort  to doucment more thorough thorughts in coprehensive github or live deploymetn posts. I  think  it's good form to link these back  to the source of inspiring conversations.

This responds  to two choiuces  we have  looking  forward. It was [announced](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1418046119908217004/1436180933903646761) so to  speka i n the Discord,  where I;'ll link back a  reply. More htan being a refernece, I just fele better with some psace to lfehs out htese thoughts.[^1]

[^1]: And the  footnotes are nice. More relevantly , I am looking into how piones[^2] use the  Github inbox x.  I remember some awesome back and forth iwth it early  one, but lately I've been manually pinging people in the Stgellar ecosystgem becasue it  can  get challenging to have everyone up-to-date when things sporead out or decentralize into thier appropriate actionable  contenxt.


[^2]: Yes, I'm  goiong  to use  this diction for a while when  it feels natural. I am going through a lot right now and it helps me process things lol. I'm also  trying to stop writting like a politician now that I have a little bit of breathing  froom which I intent to use to spur needed action.

From the  context,  the two m atters at hand are whterhter we :

- Pay thousands of dollars to  an advertising agency, andd
- Setup an Association-wide OPenAI accoutn  for members



## Google Ads

I am extrmeley ocmpetant at  google ads, and that scareds me a little.[^3]  Ive been in positions itnerting with some of these marketing agencies and learning directly from wtheir work. While there is a lot sof specialziiton and nuance in stayhing up-to-date iwth the most recent algoriuthm changes, the  core concepts don't really change.

I could dive into the accounts tommorow and have hte adspend and conversion results up drastically within a month. 

### Budget

On  the matter  of adspend, I think we should scale up slowly. At least at the estart, we obviosuly don't have the  sresources  to accidently go 20% over the allotment and then have a huge buiill. But, more importantly, we  have already seen the veriocity  with which they will rejefct  creatives. (those r the ads)

I have extensive experinece  with this  across diffrent centralized advertising pllatfomrs. The  financial educastion and self-imporvmeent  space requiresd a lot  of tact to navigate their nuanced  policies  arouynd claims and advice. PLainly, there are ways to approach this proporely over time so thatg they become compfortabel with us .

We  can  start out lower in numbers to push the boundaries and start g etting resutls with say $800/mo  spend. THen  it's a pretty  straightforward  path to upping until using most of the  generous nonfprofit credits. It's really jsut avoiding some hot keywords (like BOb pointed out) and knowing what images can be.

### Benefits

The main pro  of doign this house is that we can both view results and directly change targer  pagesd. THey would  porabbly set up conversion tracking, but that leaves us with a limited scope of optimization tools. And we might need to do some real work making a custom bot to connect clikcs to say new Discords.

Realistically,  the pagess right now are extrmeely ijnfomrative but  perhaps not the modst  converting for a brand new vistior hooked by and ad. THeseres sort o f a difference between the broad genral free educatiokn work we excelt at and bringing in new communtiy  memebrs . Because the fact o f the matter  is that not a ton of peopole are ac tively sdearchign  for information about the Dirfect Registration System., [^5]

BY doing marketing ourselves,  we cna combine the inbound cmapaign efforts with  follow-ons that keep new users engaged. PLently of platforms offer 
at least  email markteting follow-ups, which would give us a place to squeeze new visitors into via email boxes. And then we  can bring them in ads and improve.

### Passion

THis connectio nwwe share over an important topic is powerful.  It yields results which I think exceed those of a distant consultancy. I think we shoudl do what we can to incent member participation and  reward our friends even if it costs a little more than brute outsourcing.

I recall and [earll;y outreaf](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1102309240741310503/1260681999652229182)  related  to https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/797—where is  asked if ther were any artists who might want to help with a community 3D design. Later on,  we saw some exceptional 3D printing from apres which made its way itno the kit of outread ch tools. 💜 It's  a veryu doiffernt approach  to  a prbroad public bidding market of  labor because we have a shared connection that leads to care and vision embedded  in outputs.[^6]

PASSION TODO




[^3]: _See, e.g.,_ remakrs about  our  first client from low adspend [in thread](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1418046119908217004/1436462276050681918). I have't  gotten around to makeing all the Syndicatge examz reponses public,[^4]  but  I  cited more o f htis  experinece peretty exptensively in Reposnse 2. It rlates  ato a lot of the early SYndicate wrok in college and then the years of financial education before that with class/

[^4]: this has two prerequiestes: cenosring  all PII and configuring someowehre to host like the documents repo. I think I'll get around to the latter once we  get h te SDNY response [from  vote](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1435385563870924810). Propbably would owrk hwell along hte  same hosting lines as the new podcast  feed ...

[^5]: We see this pretty  directly in  t he lackluster  initial resutls targetting narrow DRS keywords . While these are the easiest to  convert  into clicks cheaply. , they will not garner material trafficc during our brand-building stage. It's  just a fact  I;ve seen  over and over in my own  campgiaghns lo., ./

[^6]: THe centralized bidding hiring does workt,  but  I really  don't like its extrernaltiies, intermediation, and negaativity. It  forces  foals  to compete in asn enviroment with imperfect information, which often just leads to a lazy answer suited by poticial needs. I've h ad plently of wood work-products  made this way, but it  crucially cremoves the incentive or ever position o f power  for independent thought  and expansive ellaborations on a scoped team agenda.



## Cnetralizaiton

Google Ads are  very  cventralized, writing  copy  is very  centralized, and access permissions  are very  centralized. We'll talk more about the last one in  the  snext section, but  I hope this framing just copes out how clear to me it is . We are a _DUNA_ proposing to do centralized things  that will drastically  help achive  our just and true mission to reform m the capital market. 

I sincerely support these present efforts. I jsut want to make this rfeally clear, because it 's  a singificant org splitting choice. In a perfect  world., there would be onyl word fof mouth.

At least in my ideal, wehgre erveryone can jsut self-orgnaize and decicate their resources to the mission 

###  Slow Way

We['ve been going at this for four years ,a dn there are still massive amounts of market pareenetration  to achieve in terms o f  general understanding of your ownership options. Iv''e done every  singlee  thing I can to make big progress wiht extrmee decentralization, and it's been a lot. It is doable,  buit at a certian point we need a consistent brand and product, wejther its accounting or educational materials.


I've thought about this a lot, and I do want to keep doing things the slow and right rway./ But we have this awesome resource in the Ad grant  opporuntity, and I think it's worth taking. THe laternate only detracts from our mission of informing the public about their options  when ivnesting.




### Trust

IT m ight take some time to formatlize this,  but obviosuly  there is  a bar we need to hit for access  to t he Ads  coinsole. If you mess up,  you could accidendltyy   spend the entire month's allotmen[^7] in a few days. THis  gets into an  earlier disusccion  of how to quanitfy trust when money  is at stake.

Early discussion  in the  DUNA meetings centered around reputations risks—,ike what  oculd h appen inf someone with a WHyDRS email a ccount sent something bad  to someone important. I followed  on with my throughts arouind commissioned salespoeople ', who i proposed post a sizable bond before beginning permissionless work using a Block  Tranfer  email and meeting schedulign software./[^8]

[^7]: or much more, although this  can surely  be limited by an executive admin.  But even the idea of having  a role like that is another layer of centralizing  complexity. My apporach  so far has been  to a

[^8]: I think direct commissions are verfy  dangerous  becasue they create a perverse i ncentive to onbaord issuers at eanyu cost e ven when they may bne detrimental to the investing public. Moreover, we put  a  really high bar on participation if you  need $50k on dpeosit  jsut to start helpign with someitnghin  you think is coo.  I think it's important we have a repitation for not serving obvious frauds.
