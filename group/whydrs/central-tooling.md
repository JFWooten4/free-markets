#  


HEllo hi!@ I am making an effort  to doucment more thorough thorughts in coprehensive github or live deploymetn posts. I  think  it's good form to link these back  to the source of inspiring conversations.

This responds  to two choiuces  we have  looking  forward. It was [announced](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1418046119908217004/1436180933903646761) so to  speka i n the Discord,  where I;'ll link back a  reply. More htan being a refernece, I just fele better with some psace to lfehs out htese thoughts.[^1]

[^1]: And the  footnotes are nice. More relevantly , I am looking into how piones[^2] use the  Github inbox x.  I remember some awesome back and forth iwth it early  one, but lately I've been manually pinging people in the Stgellar ecosystgem becasue it  can  get challenging to have everyone up-to-date when things sporead out or decentralize into thier appropriate actionable  contenxt.


[^2]: Yes, I'm  goiong  to use  this diction for a while when  it feels natural. I am going through a lot right now and it helps me process things lol. I'm also  trying to stop writting like a politician now that I have a little bit of breathing  froom which I intent to use to spur needed action.

From the  context,  the two m atters at hand are whterhter we :

- Pay thousands of dollars to  an advertising agency, andd
- Setup an Association-wide OPenAI accoutn  for members



## Google Ads

I am extrmeley ocmpetant at  google ads, and that scareds me a little.[^3]  Ive been in positions itnerting with some of these marketing agencies and learning directly from wtheir work. While there is a lot sof specialziiton and nuance in stayhing up-to-date iwth the most recent algoriuthm changes, the  core concepts don't really change.

I could dive into the accounts tommorow and have hte adspend and conversion results up drastically within a month. 

### Budget

On  the matter  of adspend, I think we should scale up slowly. At least at the estart, we obviosuly don't have the  sresources  to accidently go 20% over the allotment and then have a huge buiill. But, more importantly, we  have already seen the veriocity  with which they will rejefct  creatives. (those r the ads)

I have extensive experinece  with this  across diffrent centralized advertising pllatfomrs. The  financial educastion and self-imporvmeent  space requiresd a lot  of tact to navigate their nuanced  policies  arouynd claims and advice. PLainly, there are ways to approach this proporely over time so thatg they become compfortabel with us .

We  can  start out lower in numbers to push the boundaries and start g etting resutls with say $800/mo  spend. THen  it's a pretty  straightforward  path to upping until using most of the  generous nonfprofit credits. It's really jsut avoiding some hot keywords (like BOb pointed out) and knowing what images can be.

### Benefits

The main pro  of doign this house is that we can both view results and directly change targer  pagesd. THey would  porabbly set up conversion tracking, but that leaves us with a limited scope of optimization tools. And we might need to do some real work making a custom bot to connect clikcs to say new Discords.

Realistically,  the pagess right now are extrmeely ijnfomrative but  perhaps not the modst  converting for a brand new vistior hooked by and ad. THeseres sort o f a difference between the broad genral free educatiokn work we excelt at and bringing in new communtiy  memebrs . Because the fact o f the matter  is that not a ton of peopole are ac tively sdearchign  for information about the Dirfect Registration System., [^5]

BY doing marketing ourselves,  we cna combine the inbound cmapaign efforts with  follow-ons that keep new users engaged. PLently of platforms offer 
at least  email markteting follow-ups, which would give us a place to squeeze new visitors into via email boxes. And then we  can bring them in ads and improve.

### Passion

THis connectio nwwe share over an important topic is powerful.  It yields results which I think exceed those of a distant consultancy. I think we shoudl do what we can to incent member participation and  reward our friends even if it costs a little more than brute outsourcing.

I recall and [earll;y outreaf](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1102309240741310503/1260681999652229182)  related  to https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/797—where is  asked if ther were any artists who might want to help with a community 3D design. Later on,  we saw some exceptional 3D printing from apres which made its way itno the kit of outread ch tools. 💜 It's  a veryu doiffernt approach  to  a prbroad public bidding market of  labor because we have a shared connection that leads to care and vision embedded  in outputs.[^6]

I have't  gotten around to makeing all the Syndicatge examz reponses public,[^4]  but  I  cited more o f htis  experinece peretty exptensively in Reposnse 2.

[^4]: this has two prerequiestes: cenosring  all PII and configuring someowehre to host like the documents repo. I think I'll get around to the latter once we  get h te SDNY response [from  vote](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1435385563870924810). Propbably would owrk hwell along hte  same hosting lines as the new podcast  feed ...

[^5]: We see this pretty  directly in  t he lackluster  initial resutls targetting narrow DRS keywords . While these are the easiest to  convert  into clicks cheaply. , they will not garner material trafficc during our brand-building stage. It's  just a fact  I;ve seen  over and over in my own  campgiaghns lo., ./

[^6]: THe centralized bidding hiring does workt,  but  I really  don't like its extrernaltiies, intermediation, and negaativity. It  forces  foals  to compete in asn enviroment with imperfect information, which often just leads to a lazy answer suited by poticial needs. I've h ad plently of wood work-products  made this way, but it  crucially cremoves the incentive or ever position o f power  for independent thought  and expansive ellaborations on a scoped team agenda.
