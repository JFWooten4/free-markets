HEllo hi!@ I am making an effort  to doucment more thorough thorughts in coprehensive github or live deploymetn posts. I  think  it's good form to link these back  to the source of inspiring conversations.

This responds  to two choiuces  we have  looking  forward. It was [announced](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1418046119908217004/1436180933903646761) so to  speka i n the Discord,  where I;'ll link back a  reply. More htan being a refernece, I just fele better with some psace to lfehs out htese thoughts.[^1]

[^1]: And the  footnotes are nice. More relevantly , I am looking into how piones[^2] use the  Github inbox x.  I remember some awesome back and forth iwth it early  one, but lately I've been manually pinging people in the Stgellar ecosystgem becasue it  can  get challenging to have everyone up-to-date when things sporead out or decentralize into thier appropriate actionable  contenxt.


[^2]: Yes, I'm  goiong  to use  this diction for a while when  it feels natural. I am going through a lot right now and it helps me process things lol. I'm also  trying to stop writting like a politician now that I have a little bit of breathing  froom which I intent to use to spur needed action.

From the  context,  the two m atters at hand are whterhter we :

- Pay thousands of dollars to  an advertising agency, andd
- Setup an Association-wide OPenAI accoutn  for 



## Google Ads





## ChatGPT
