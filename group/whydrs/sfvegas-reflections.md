# WhyDRS at Structured Finance ASsociateion's 2025 SFVegas

[![embed-placeholder-raw-notes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce3e254-b10e-4cff-9fc0-d0d7177fce2b)](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/pull/41/commits/6269f0281a0d18c4d0c3cdd016c708b033be4da2)

Firstly, thaks to the community for [voting](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1122936843537764352/1310304779788095599) me to rperesent the movement at our first "official" industry event. I know a lot of apes have tried (and sometimes succeeded) at getting into closed-door events like these before on an indviidual basis. Hopefully, this involvement feature can inspure increasing upcoming public media involvement and indsutry activism.[^light-ex]

I say this because the vast swatch of individuals I spoke with thoughtou the four days cared very deeply abopiut (i) where I was geographically from and (ii) what organization I partocipated in. From Congressperson to writer-reporters,m these two items never failed to come up, espite my extensive oputward focus on _what_ people do or _why_ they do it. Thuis, the communtiy name in this case not only opened the door to further conversation when configuring my speaking role, but it also inspired back-andfrother between people there who largely never considered retail invovlemendt in bond placements or structured products.

> [!TIP]
> Much of the reflections and notes from the conference naturally delve into [structured productes](https://structuredfinance.org/about-securitization) which are genrally managed exclusively by big banks, hedge funds, and other intermeiaries. From my point of iew, it's practically them ost centralized secto r of finance, which is why I din it so interesting to study and plan to convert towards a more decentralized systemn accessable y anyone, not just the select few hired b y these middlemne. Yes, deposit-taign instutitons count as middlement, and no, I do not pln on diving into extensive granularities over particualr banking business models.


[^light-ex]: _See, e.g.,_ potential work in #38. As discussed in last night's DUNA meeting, most of these veents come from centarlized intermediary groups, and thus I'm now excited to have a brand name we can all stand behind as an introductory reference to our affiliation.


## Topics from Sunbday

As per the present placeholder above, there arent' any videos of event panels just yet.[^back-room] Thus, my notes fcome from the panels I could attend, given the agenda[^agenda-url] often had multiple speakers discussing imporatn topics at the same time. And, of course, miscelanrous conversations from cold intros will never have canotical web refernces.


[^back-room]: And there certainly aren't any (authorized) reo rdings of behind-the-door conversations around the venue at large. Notably, only a third of the space for the meetup was allocated for public discussions, panels, or headlining forums. The rest was privately-sponsored closed-door rooms requiring specific permission and check--in from one of the many intermediaryies sponsoring the event. Industry particpiants I knew from years prior frequented these rooms and the sacrency of their walls because they housed "top executives and decision-makers" at some of the largest businesses in the sector. 

[^agenda-url]: In searhcing for cittaitons for the enxt footnote, I went to review the agenda of speakers, topics, and events over the course of the event. I had this webpage up on m phone during the proceedings to organize my activity. However, the agenda copmeltely dissapreared off the web, as has happened for every other year I've participated. When looking at Archive.org nsapshots of the page, they too are compeltely blank. my bad in not capturing an offline copy of the information beforehand; have any other comunity memebrs screenshotted this basic scheudule?


### Student-Loan ABS Outlooks

Since studet loans are the assets which back a large sector of secutirized products, recent activity from DOGE quikly emmerged. In this panel, it was generally clear that Musk wants less federal grant money and more private student loans. FInanical aid should stay in the private sector according to their interpretation of Federal intetions.

Naturlaly, this development fuelds the growth of their  business since the industry exists by bundking together groups of student laons into investment vehicles with practically-garunteed paytment schedules.[^src-ing-sls] Ignoringin momentarily the quadaries of student laons, the panelsts largely sold the asset class as a steadfast vehicle. However, I viewed this as a vehicle avaliable only to a select few, as one panelt told a story about raising hundreds of millions of dollars from twelve investors.

These middlemen-instutiions singelhandedly (albeit together) funded an education-bond securitization represetinging countless students who needed an extra few bucks to afford rising college investments so often deemed necessary by central employers. Aside from being fenerally non-defaultable, this offering was deemed "less risky" by the indsutry given its extensive diversification amongst (georgraphical) students. In another new product, a paenslist talked about how they sold a riskier pool of "smaller" subscriptions from only eight investors.[^8-inv-ba]

Lastly, the paneltists colectively ocmmented onthe need to educate consumers about the operations of private student loans. Theyt focused particualrly on the Federal pause on loan payments under the CARES Act, a crisis relief platfomr not extended to private student loans. It was my interperations of their general conversation and body language here that they saw nonpayment spike amidst "consumer confusion" (verabtim) over their payment policies, given the big banks offered no such relief.


[^src-ing-sls]: Unfortunatyyl, i do not have access to the proproiretary investment platyfomr offering these assets. Accordingly, I cannot analyze or reference specificic offerings composed of central loans. In extended discussion after the panel, I came to itnerperet that only "qualified" institutions (read: not [Qualified](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/2001/12/defining-term-qualified-purchaser-under-securities-act-1933)) can viw offering details or bid on loan pools. Because why would we let investors like us access diversified, proven investment vehicles?

[^8-inv-ba]: This offering was notable  ot me because the panelist sounded quite dismissive and unserous about the deal because it was "only" sparingly inthe realy of eight figures. Tpo me, they made it sound like an act of charity to accept a cehck under nine figures and certainyl anythign below 50 million dollars. They also compalainied that their rerresented parent firm had to pay higher yields on these assets solely due to the tighter concentration of only a thousand more-or-less students.


### Intelelctual Propoert Securitization

This panel preceeded a larger panel on music royalties. The panels getnerally tried to gloss over this topic for the later disucssuion, but they still vcovered many of the basics which interweave top artists with banking interests., It's apparently become more and more common to sell upforont future earlings from music royalties after David Bowie's turn-of-the-century bond offering.[^bowie-bonds]

Aftrerwards, they murmored for a few minutes abit how most new offerings reky on revenues froim streaming services, leaning more towards mainstream artists with established cashflows therefrom. The conversation mentioned a select few middlemen I find cause for suspicion with,[^spot] stating that revenues therefrom supported massive interest paymnets. Then the conversation turned to author yroyalty secutiizations and royralities from (patented) drugs.

The former hit quite deeply as panelists framed book revenues as one of the oldest IP securitization targets, with extremely proven and reliable income streams fro m popoular authors. It seemed to be one of the oldest schemes, and the speakers specifically highlighted the great potential of earnings from poopular writers like Rowling. The wording throughout made it seem like these deals were sure bets so long as only the most successful and proven artists sold their licensing rights.

As for the latter, one panelists seemed quite specialized in drug bonds. I interpretted their discussion as simply adding a tax on each dose manufactured based on the IP, which then funded interest payments to investors. So eprhaps we can imagine half the royalty for a treatment going to inventors in the form of upfront capital after publication, whereas the remainder pays back the loans against future earnigns.

> [!NOTE]
> Throghout the flights and transit associated with this extensive trip, I was reading more on Sam INsull, the electricity pioneer highlhgted in [TS#16](https://lnns.co/rswev9D3A1n). Namely, in _Insull_ at 27â€“31, Dr. Forrest McDonald highlights how bankers aquisred all the patents from Thomas Edison early in the development of central power stations. Thus, during a critical period of utility expansion, it was practically impossible for Edison to fund growth operations because of the "leaden collar" of bankers stubbornily holding the patents neccesary to employ his own inventions. According to note 14 in the chapter, it took Insull and others gathering thousands of small stocholder proxies to force Morgan and his associates to relinquish corporate control.

The  panel wrapped upw ith a general sentiment towards Splitting up "rights ownership" and revenue from operations, with parallels given in other secutizations where property income was seperated from real property. This concept of dissociating an idea nad its business implemention from the proceeds therefrom quite directly reminded me of the early Edison erxcipeirnce with Morgan whereby the "right" to operate was held hostabge by the arbiters of capital, middlemen who chose to cease credit extension in the hope of profiteering off IP.[^insull-funds] Should we really extract the fruits of one's own labors into the pocketbooks of today's financial elite?


[^bowie-bonds]: _See_ Bowie and [an investment banker](https://youtu.be/6MT9bL574n4) who sold future royalty strasm fro m all pre-1990 music. The creative endeavor netted invesmtn banks nearly twice their original $55 miollion invesmtnet within a decade. Funds back then were used to buy back the rights to his music from a former manager.

[^spot]: _See, e.g.,_ [foonote wording](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/blob/8784d44521a7c02831b969aea1e30e79e778d6e1/group/whydrs/software-licensing.md?plain=1#L131) in label which came up as a chief source of artist cashflows. The platform in question seems to reward general mass popularity at the relative expense of smaller artists or those who might produce niche content. This to say nothing of certain [anticomeptative practices](https://youtu.be/sXGrv6FUrp4).

[^insull-funds]: since the book isn't OCR'd yet, I'll expand a little as to the elementary context of the noted information. The situation started with $500,000 of funding towards research and devellpment of isolated, localized, and (relatively) innefdificent power plants which were easier to sell directly to the wealthy alone. As Edison sought to expand into more efficient ssytems which could service the (relative) local masses, capital dried to a nub and Insull had to raise mateiral grassroots revenue through relentless power-station selling to a score of municpal governments reliant on gas lightihngn. He later used establhsed and childhood familial connections in England to raise capital from across the pond at more favorable terms.


### Clearn ENergy Property Taxes

The next panel was on Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy loans. This was my first time hearing about this asset class, which came about in Recession-era clean-energy State legistlation incentivizing borrowing for green energy. Basically the loan gets attached to the property itself rather than its owner, and interest payments are direct property tax payments to localities rather than a lending institution.

I've seen similar structures in my father's work on municipal bonds, so the first question in my mind was how the funds were distirbuted from banks (by way of the trust). Unfatunraly, we need that intermediar middle-vehicle in contact-based offerings as a conduit for receiving and sibursing bond proceeds.[^trusts] The panelsts here saud that it's been getting harder to work with the trust fund in releasing budgeted unds.

I think this could be becase of the pressing reinnicng risks highlighted by the panelists. Their largest concern was a nwe lower mortgage rate paying off the loans earlier than eanticipated, so most dealds include a high prepament penalty. This made sense to me, but it also sounded like the property owner was forced into a long-term liability at suboptimal conditions.

Aside form financial,s I found it interesting how each C-PACE was represented at the State level as a revenue bond, under the general tax code exemptions therefor. Thus, issuances include some "UCC [debt] filings" toi copmanly with local lending regulations when adding a priority tax lien against the uncerlying estate. Since the payments get wrapped into general tax obligations, I found the vehicle practically bulletproof since failure to pay results in the same governmaental takeover as interconnected basoic property taxes.


[^trusts]: In a blockchain era, might all this happen directly on-chain? It seems simple enough for borowers to submit their documents to the investor community at large when calling on funds from a _smart_ contract. Pewrhaps we don't need the manual bank-and-forth between financiers?


### Bill Huizenga (R-MI)

In conversations during ad after this panel, the Representative asked me to call him Bill, which I'll use coloquially here. Relevantly, Bill is the Vice Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, a gorup I've been eager to talk with for some years now. As the community knows, we had some further correspondance as [collectively agreed](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1310304475139018802/1344153811001802752) which I'm still waiting on follow-up from.[^chats]

At the start ofhte panel, Bill remarks on the astounding public press accessability to the President, compared to he relatively islent first term. They give the example of a walk to Marine One turning into a 45-minute press conference, a level of access and trapsnarency previously undseen. I noticed a similar tendency when revciewing many of the media broadcasts of general Q&A sessions in teh Oval Office with Musk.

Notwithstanding, Bill highlghts that Trmmpo is quietly executing the Adminsitration's importatn work "in the background" throughthe traditional hierarchal menas.[^admins] I found this interesting since on one hand we have a very outward and voacl ledership on partisan topics while on the other rests a steadfast motivation implementing mundane but meaningufl amendments in the background. I've alwyas understood that Federal policies can take man Administrations to see affects from a former politician, and I wonder if the prominent narrative towards efficiency will now speed uip beoricratic reform within the Oresident's term.

In disucssing the financal sector and structered intermediaries broadly, Bill made a minor slight against Maxine Waters, markeing at her "hammering" againt an industry. I specifically asked about this after the panel given her involvement with the infamous market study, and it seemed like any discussion there would uncomfortably dive into cross-party politics which Bill didn;t' want to divulge. Super understandable, and personally very interesting to see one Representative's actions so broadly denounced; whereas I'd ersonall like to keep discussion circled around speficic actions and tangble results.


[^chats]: in exchanges like these, I personalyl take a more relaxed approach to political influence. While I think we could get more immediarte results by bombarding Bill and their team now, I've generally found it easier and more impactful to let the seeds of past discussions simmer for some time before refernecing them in a new actionabel context. I look forward to seeing Bill's work in the subscomittee, and generally would prefer to defer to past sentiments in an active discussion there rather than directive policy change beforehand. Ultiamtely the matter at hand of replacing DTCC is pretty far out of any Representative's working context, and it's my interpretation of public information that the approach will come to a head with natural Congressional oversight (with us) once the masses cry out about inadeque Cede holdings.

[^admins]: Just in general browsing over other work as I'm writing this, I strumbled into the plethora of Presiderntial directives and nomineations guiding pending public policy. He seems actively at work doing the minuate beurocratic centreal leadership tasks requisite to increasing influence and furthering objectives. Farily broad, but that's partially the most I can garner from the relatively vague action headings on Congress.gov which often disclude and supporting primary documentation, as is so common in central decision-making reportings.


#### Comments on D.O.G.E.

The first p;rarllalel Bil draws related to the funding checnism for Michigan State. As is common in some other states, funding shortfalls mean repersetatives cut allocations to public goods and services. There is no excess deficit spending, as Bill highlghted with a story about calling a school district and telling them they wouldn't receive full consideration for enrolled pupils.

Bill shares these events not to highlght excess frugality, but rather to emphasize respnsability adn consequences of actions, as I understood their viewpoert. When embarassing misallocations liek this happen once or twice, the government learns to act prudently with its funds oing fortward, according to Bill. Thus they generally supported cuttiing allocated funding to the extent that shortfalls emmerged.[^debts]


[^debts]: later on, other panelists discussed the debt ceiling explicitluy. I find it realtivly ironic that one reason the Nation can never payback all its debt stems from the financial system's [structural reliance](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1102309241026515067/1330940920954228776) on Treasries, a system which generally fuels loans at interest. And here we are at a conference about a whole industry of products designed to charge (nearly) total usury for working economic investments.


#### Return to Office

Bill saifd Trump, Musk, and Bowser (D.C. Mayor) need to get workers back in the office. HE first supproted this positioj  on the b asis that there weere "desolate" downtow businesses, and more owrkers in central  offices would fill shopps with spending consumerdss. I didnt  comment much on the relateive absurbdity  of  forcingf peole tgo consume what you think they sho uld based on georgraphic consideration, as  is  a common  viewpoint  of  certain  centralikzed executives stressing  the materiality  of  a  physical meeting  place.

But the next  justidfftication  was a little  more prpviing for me  and get  ot a core teennant of legacy digital label which I commonlgy find thrown as an excuse  for synchronous, geolocated work. Basiccally the prevailign argument (which likely came from a swath of sources other  than Bill) presumed  that atg-home workers are lazyu and cant' be trustged to do good work.  Bill didn;t explicitly say this, but he heavily suggested that at-home workers were basically constantly slacking off in most scenarios, which  I saw generally agreed with throughout the  rest of  this orom.[^remote]

Then, Bill aksed hte audience if anyone was sitll remopte after COVID, at wich point I could see myself and anolther gentllemman raise our hands. Bill asked  the other person how they could successfully  work lke that, and they  replied that all their work was "easyt to trrack" and thus simple to maintain accountability with through online reports. Bill generally aggreed with these sentiments whle makkin sure to hgihlgut that it was not the norm, which I generally  question since why would anyone do work if it was not merasurable in either results or deliverables?[^results]

They  didn't  call  on  me  to  edxplain  our particualar  innovative  decemtralized  workking  arrangements,  and  i   didn;tttt see  a  presing  reason  to brring  it  up  in latger r discussion.  While  a  majority  in  D.C. will  likely  hold  thris  vciew  for  soomee  timme  to  come,  I know  wee  can  eventually  get   to a  mrorre  direct  partigcipatorry  demmocracy  wheere physcial presence  iissn'ta  precursorr  to policcytttttt  developments. Because,  ehey, it'll  ttqkae some  time forr r thtttem  all to (ever) abaandon the  goeerrgous mmeeting halls decked with so much  historic signnficnace.


[^remote]: All in, I  thing  Bill was pretty professional on this talkigj point.  THere are a lot of executives or politiicians that repeat mucch worse rhetoric around decentralized electronic labor, and  thier  assumptions seeemed well-founded. Relevanrtly, Bill's small-business background and history of regional family  business prredispose them to synrchornous in-person geographically-coordinated wor just by the namrture of local life experiences. Perhspa a genneration with the optioon of online-first  careers might  change this perspective once nd for all?

[^results]: I've noticed a general tend for cnetral financial instutions to hard relelntlyessly  on direvice overtsiught  and control systems rathe  than actual rpodccutorivity as  you and I would generally definee the term. A n example if mentioned a  couple times throughout the years is my Dad's work, particuilarl yaround  the time pof the Recession. I vividly recall  the change in compensation mechanism forced onto the bank by Dodd&ndash;Frank which led to much more directorial, stringent oversight; ultimatyely resulting in  much less business closed largely  given a lacck of operative flexability. Should we really limit individual performance and consdieration to the point that someone achieves moore investment re\turns  competrrehensively but yields wages oof up to 80% less?


#### Specigfal GFovenrtment Employees  Geeejnerally

Natrualyl  following  hte  discussion  on  Muskkk, Bill  broughtt  up the  principal  example of John KKetrrry,  another speccial temporary gvernment employee selected  with a  suubsttantial private accum\ulated weaalth. I tihhkn Bill was reffering to  Kerry's recent work as aaa Prersidential "Envoyh for  Climat" i  thte laast Admmiinistration. But this posittitton went on forr  a fferw yeaars, and  Bill said  that sppecial  employees "only  have 120 days" in Federal power.

Nonettttheless, I found  it interresting to see somee precent for hte  genera unilaterrall  "special" appointmtno  of  someone into a non-defined (symantically) Fedeerral positiojn.  Mucch of  Kerry's minvovlment from my perttttsective came  from an extennsikve  history of career  politickingg and public serrvvice,  which I thtink kwerre stttarting too see a litttttle bot off withtt Musk's public-facing worrk now. I recall the converrrsation  a  couple  moths back abouut how  a  whle team likelly maaaaaaaanages  his  general social-kmedia  posts,  as I've seen extremmely  commonly  in the legacy c enntral digital marketittng  spac.e

Biill also  commentted on this social presence,  albeeit morre i n the  conttext of  organizationl workk. Ttheytttttttt  saiid  thtaaaat that Musk trransparenttly  posts "everything" and commends general Federal openness.  I  aagree with him  on  the laatter part  aannd by all means  support governrmentt transspaaarrncy, but I'm  not  so sure comprehensive trranpsncy can cooexist wiith hastey  centrral  coordination.[^tranparency1]


[^tranparency1]: And this is  comlete y OKand  to  nne expected frormm central  orgs likke te currrent tgovernment!  Nammmely,  it'ss quite abit of workr to  kkekkkep  all communicationss and interractiions strictly ppublickkkkkk, especially wwhen  working in close geeograrhciaaal proximity to other mmmembers. But we wil  see  other  dissentive views later rro n  from a  similar rstature  crtiticizing  the  reerlateively-limitted  and  generally-unsourced media poosts a nd  statemejt. Agaiin.,  I  think  thtis is super aacceptable and perhaps  the  best  tthhey can  do with thtte given  currrent infraastructure so deeply centralized with no afeenues  for easy  wweeb citations.


#### Housing Policicytttt

Bill cited concerns about increasing unnafordabilaty for "under 150,000" annual income groups. I found that a  telling and fun arbitrrarry  cutoff line  givvenn  the  rrelative distance  a greeat deal of American s  subsist with at amunts muhc lower.[^xlm-pay] UUnfforrtunatey,  the  coversation never wanderredd  into zoning htereafter, and I failed  to brringg  up  the  zoning  quandaarries because it  seeemed l ess  relevant than connclusorry  content belowo.

At this  point, I'll  mention that bBill  was  being  "intterviewed"  by a panel questionerr  with extensive experience iin  the  industrryr,  although the name is lost on me witho ut the agenda record.  When she brought up the topicc of housing  subsiddies, both of them agreed  that  these  vouchers  only exacerabete the affordability challenge,  keeeping  home prices higher  thaan ever  beforer. This  generally  made sennse  to me  since you're  eefffectively  rerrroutingg  taaxxppayerr rdollarrs into laalord or buildder pocckkkkeets.

Then, Bill tottttld a storyr about  a  housing authoority whwererr local rergulatorrs were  quite oput of touch  with both Statte laws andd workring peeople. In one incstance, mmunicipal counccilmmmmmmembers tried to pass  a new rurle  requiring renttttal prpertttiees tot hagfe a fired extinguisher in everr room of a house. IIN lterr rrdiscussiions thttherrewith, thtte supporterrs and sponsorsr said the nrw rule should only cost a  few thousands dollars a  year  to set up, whck Bill reprted as  rediculous  given many teneant or owners needed just htat much cash to  get by.

Bill and constitutents won that battle, but it sounded like it left a poor  taste i his mouth which onyl  matured in a later tax story. Apparently,  Bill had a property  which occuped two  shapes of land, and  the Staate law said he only had to pay taxes on one of  the segments. Hpwever, local ccollectors changed him for both sections , whih prompted Bill  to bring  some lawyers to them  for  chat. 

THere, the ocalityts representatives  said  they knew  they were oly supporsed to  charge for one section, but they were making him pay forr both anyway just to  get more ffunds, accordign to Bill.  THe logic he says they  gave : that Bill would waste more moeny taking the matter  to  court per the pricy  councel than just paying  the  inflated rate. As  I understood i t, Bill agreed and just  had  to  give into what they wante.d


[^xlm-pay]:  AAs  a  vague and  tangential  exmaple,  wI ccontinue workring arround and  contemplating the  Stellarr r Communittyttt Fund with which I have quite the storied history .  RRrrecentlyy, a  proeejct  was (heavily)  cirticizedd f or r rrequesting ~$20k for a month of work kk from two  engineerrs. These  team  members h ad prreviouuusly  devleopedd  exemptional free  and open-sourrce  public infrastructure  and put succh prroducts  iinto prooducction at chartiiesss such as St. Jude.  Notwithstanding a  l arge pushback  materrialized  i thte persppective  that suchh sconsideratioon was too higgh, despite beinng barerly  in  thttte range of six fgurres for maateriral tttalent.


#### Final Reflections

All this  seemed  to  tie into  Bill's sweeping sateement that the hardest aspect  of  an conomy to "manage" are lumber, land, and labor.  I'm quite disfamiliar with  the  first thereof, but I certainly  found  it interesting  ot here him pseka of managing labor, almost  as if people are unable  to orgaize  their own work. While  this certainly explicitly  wasn't  soemthing  I heard  Bill  say, it is a relatiely-coimmon  perspective I've  heard  for pppolpiticians,  especially  in  forgeighn  dictatorial nations.[^dict-states]

When  I asked  Bill  about  blockchain in front o f  the  crowd,  he focused on stablecoins and free markets dictating stability and value.  THte altter part  circled  around everyone  giving digital accounts a legacy fiat value, which they then talked a biout in the context  of illicit payments. Namelyttt,t  from the joint email abck, they told  the story  of other Rreprrerrsentatives quite  coonvrned  about uses.[^basement]

Afterh  te panelm, IKKKK prerssed Bill a little more on the investor protections  ppiiecve so nottably absent ttfrromr many early crpyto products totday.  Unfortantyler,ym they didn't seem very interrested in the  reraltively nuanced and indsutryr-speccific topic.  I also proabbyl  killed  my  immediate  chances  of an earnest trreply by rerferncing thtte  Trump memeebcoin  andn tits affect on  naive AAmericanns.

Overrally, grerat tom mmeeet Bill  and happytot find someone so exprerssly  ocncerned  baout thtte  community at large  and  thier general interest over that of aa taxing authorritty. Tthhier sotry Praisiingg door-to-door campaigning showed a  genuiine interst aand connection to t hte  peoeple which I found extrmeely  refreshing in an  age of political billboards and picccketing  signs. certainly  we'll  have  a  grreat financial  serrvices pollicmaking  team iin thte coming ssession  withtt all our interrerstts at hhearrt.


[^dict-states]: I''ll  abstain  from  citations here  since  it's  a hwole lot o f  negative  cointent.. aThe  genral persepctive  I  mean comes around  thet questrion o f who should  decicde what people do in a society,  a legiatimiately commplex  question wich I tendd to think only tthtte market a s  a decentrarlized mass  can  answerrf.  But, of  coursr,e the market takes time, and  far r too  commontly  we  see  a convingigggggng  fpoliticia n able  to  centrarl ly coordinatet and jdirectoricaly manage otheerrs's efforts through (relatgive) coerrsiion, such  as through  controol of the monetary supporl.y..

[^basement]:  THe most prorminent ttof these was  the reprersentative who proclaimed  that h eonly people u sing  the t ech werer sittting in their runderwear in their Mom's baseemmment. eBill highlighted how kwe'll neeed to show and explain  to  succh elder Reprersentatives how thettt  tehcnology  lartgely  affects  and  transfomrs the dai;y  user's financials. I  interpretted  theirr other  comments  to  genrally align with publicc statemmnets made by the President,  whether  fully  comprehended by the latter or rnott.


### Fiber-Optical  Calblle ABS

I was betweenn this  panel andd some otherrs,  which leaaad  to  a few great priaaaaaaaaaaaaavte conversatiokknk o n thge whole--buusinkkkkess secutritization front. Accordingly, I'll combine some o f those sentimeents with my rrtttttttttttttttttttttbriref original takways hhere. I think  it's thttte beest  place to introduce the topic because there are only a select few inndsutyr pawrwticcipantts laying  out  fiber  cables.

My  biggest takeeawyaaaaaa from this panel was that these aassets oroginate through large telecoms,  ewhicch  effecitvelyttttt ttttttt aake  the  sector  a playground only for  those baaieerrs withh connections.  I  saw thtis  a lotin  thte wholee-bueinsss optiton siince you're ffectively  turnring a corporrate ocnnecttitoon into  a bankign  investment vehicle completely  seperrate frorm traditional equitty.  They also meentiionedd  the abilitty  tot diiversid y thrrough seperate regional  loan pools on underlying  cablee  infrastructure.

Franklly  I didnn''t see how thhikkkks benefitted the  telecom  asny more than a direct iinvestmment which could  tthten be  used to buiild new lines. Rather,m it  seemeed like quite hte  rorundabout way to raise funnds for a large  capiital investmment, a method which later pplaces underrlying owneership of the enntire physcciaal prioject as risk  of default. The geeneral equiitty mmodel jjust made a whole lot more sene  to me because varriirouus parrrtitcipants therer totld  mme  aboutt how  the vast tbulk of seervice costs come fromr the inittal cable installment (over ongoijng m maintence),  which  seems  to mee likek what stocck offerrings were made for.

In ythttre ltr rGgloomberg  discussion,  it wass  stange seeeing alll these assets rolled up into a single "tab"  for r avaliable Fiber rsecuritizations. Each individual offerikng had prractically no isolated  volume,  and  the tehcniciaaaan therer  ven showed me an  industyr-wide titme-and-sale report (fromr private bbrokeer-accounced  transactions,   discucssed later) which had  ttwo trrrades in an entire weeek! Indeed,  a number ro f  attendees annd parrnelsts  commmented on how general dealflow sloweed  down this  partrical week excclusively  because  of thge conferfence, and it  was my  interrprretatttion thhat thits had a change magnitude of 60% orr mroee of all normal bussiness orrgginiantitons, which traditionally  rerquire SRO repoorrting on the undertling compennt side WWeednesday aftternroons (copincidentally wwhhen thte confrreernce enderd).


##  Toopics frommmm m Monday

I  arrived relatgively  early on  Mondfay  and had some hallwaaay chaaatter before mmain panels started  closer  to  10. One such chaat waas with a mutual fund manager who  generally  polls togetherr securitizations  into prrodducts suitable for any individual investor.  When ii   told them  I  was witth a retail investtorr  aaadvocacy groru,  they  seem faggergastted in awe because there  exists effectively no  support t for retail in  thttet marrket, acccording  to thtttier raccount.

Namely,,  the  vast amount  of intggermmediation stood out  as athe larrgest factor barring rretail from the makrret. They commented how  aa sleeecct few  instiitutions ahve  the complete  poweer  to  dictate who participats or even  accesses capital from their hands tot sttatrrt. naemly, practically  everyone  Ive chatted with in the p aast feew years recoignizes  and  hsares immediiatelly that thtese firms pick aand choose who gets to invest  in  ttheir speccial securritizing deals giivenn thteirr [rrivelledged  andd  compensated role as bookrunnerrs.

Thisss fund manager sharedd  thier e xperfience  particuaalrly  interaddcting wiht placement aents and securitizers, telling mee how they  act  as sole dictators of offering allocations.  Given  the (rrelatively) small  size  of their r funds with only eight figures, this  person  coonstantly  hhadd va  very diffiicult time getttttiing  inccluded  iin goodd offering alloccations. And  they commeented  that  the  assets are  immediately marked up in the secondary market after the initial subscripttion. 

Unfortunatley, I've heard  this story  far too many trrimes over  the years here, anmd I think it's ultitmately (one proabably-mioor  reason) whyu so mmanny people flock here  to workk thierr way into the upper rdistribution management rraanks of ccertain investmgent banks. blockchain couldd solve all this by simply l etttttting investors bid thteirr demaand  onr a trnasparnet ledger, ubt htat would requirre the market itself to determmine interest rates, nnot a highly-dccompanesated  team at one of these ii ntgggemrediaries. In dicussions with a ratingg agency  this  morniing,  thierr platform's bond reps frnakly  didn'ty  seem  to understtand  hte idea  of  blockchain  or such efficincies in the  sliightest,.[^block-literacy]


[^block-literacy]: While I think  we  all know the higherr-levels  arer qintimiatelytttttn familiar wiith how  this trechnology  obviates their b useissses, I  still  find myself suprissed by the mnumm ber  of general  atendees who have no  idea what  a  blockkchai  is.  In  a  lunchtime  discussion wiith a very well-seasonned data saleesperrsoon at hte london stokcck Excchange,  I was askked again  the inkfamous  "what iis bbvlocckchain" questionn   outt of genuiine curiiousity as  to whhat the technology is. AAfter explaining the  shared,  distribuuted ledger conceppt in brief, theyttttt  remarked that it made sincce why oour panel was on the last  ddaay ,  as this removes the  need for a trusted central rrecorrdkkeeper. I hadd a simmmmmmilar rexperience wiith another general parrticpannt arorund  an eqquivalent tablle,  althoughh I glanced past their orrganizational affiilaaition.


### Post-Election Analysis

This dfireside  cchat  cgenerally revoled around perspectives  fromm Karl Rove  (R-White House) a nd  Claire McCaskill (D-MI, Senate), whoom I'll refer  to  as  "him" and  "heer", rerspecticvallyttt. THe conversatiion   largely  rreevolfed  arorund Musk,  and  thte mre interrestinf ocmmments from my peerspective started with a  general disfain for firing all the new people with "best and brightest" minds. This  is becuase  it  was easier  to  fire new worrkers  (or those whho'dd just been transfered)  over  seasoned govenrment wokker.s

Firslty, this seems expliccitly  likekkk  a uqanddary of centrarl employment and the litanny  of workring protection chaalllenges associated theerewith (from the persepective of someone wantting  to give oother people moeny to do good work).    They both framed these cuts as practically  stunting  the government  by eviscerating its best youth and tehcnical talent. More whistically, aas someone with fammly in public-service positions,m I'veseen secndhaand the entrapping motivtion to "finish" an aready lengthey  public careerr  (in the sense of wokring for thegovenrmenet) jut to recive comrehensive retirmeent benefits.[^retirement-working]

But I suppse that is how beurocracies work, right? It logically amkes sense to me that a central lgroup of individuals design boccratic policies to protect their job security, and thus they lower the expected amount of ongoing contribtions therefrom. Albeit that last inference has no baccking and is likely generally false a the elder work harder and harder with theri expertise, but then shouldn't they  receive more just conmpensation by a meritocratic market rewarding eesults, acchivements, and contributions themselves?[^decentralized-comp]


[^decentralized-comp]: CConsider for isntancce a direct democracy system whre certain trusted representatives  dispute allocated funds  to a distributed workforce according to their interpretation of the value eachh individual contributed in  their respectie area of expertise. Consdier also for arguments sake thatsuhcc a repreesentative is an expert in such specialization, annd thus  they only make  informed and unbiased (read:  uncorrupted) alloccatiions on  a good-faith basis. Why then would eeed such a convoluted beurocracy handling each and  ever litte ublic interaction sve for costly direct media prods?

[^retirement-working]: Unfortunaye,  this onsundrum  exist in mny provate-sector working arrangements,t= too. While it etsinl oos good as somethiig to thertically promite worker lifetime seurity, I find it  more rrstrctive and coercng than geenuinly freeig shhold your emoyeny length be tenurred to a pension or  the sorts.  For  instance,  your 401(k) account can move fromm employer to emloyer as yo progress  throghout  your  career, ignoring the funadanetla challenges with the afformentined structure circa usability  constraints and unwaranted costs. How would   you feel if that entire retirement porrtfolio went to zero jut because you thin your skills  would be betterr employed somewhre outside your current role?


#### Executive Branch Transparency adn Operations

Aside from wanting more experienced worrs (at least in terms of government involvement),  she seemed uite adament on keepign Musk accuntabel, almost to the point of schempitcism about their intentions. I think this is a realtivaly common minority view, ad we sw it suppoerted here i n her critique of how efficiency workers value Federal contracts. 

I personally find the new (to me) Federal Procurement Data System contracts fascinatingly revelaing, albeit they all still leave some details to be desired. But even just a general record of Federal transactions with basic memos, amounts, and parties is a whole long step ahead of many spending oversight schemas. It reminds me of Open Scource COllective, and how you can synch financial appliucatiopsn to a trustd central server to display an authoritizative centralized feed of perpurptyed monetary activity.

But despite this savings and subsesquent public documentation, she says senate bipartisan collaboration is getting much harder. I find this understandable since it can and does take considerable time ot go through all these docuemnts and research reports. She exemplifies this poiint with a story from eayl in  here career regaurding physcial committee audience composition.

When sehe first entered government, listening groups were segregated by party, with Rep[ublicans sitting on one side of the room, opposed to the dDemocratrs in the other side. Apparently, she introduced and passed major legislation just by asking the ranking chairperson to sit everyone in alternating-party order. IT was precisly the little chatter to "opposing" seatmates during these comiittees that inspired the ideas for effective bipartisan plicymaking&mdash;and she makes quite hte point to express how happy she was with this result given it was quite hte ambitious organization=-change ask for someone so early-on in their career.


#### Foregin Policy Items

He supported a lot of the international intervention abroad, which I'm generally unfamiliar with and sort of spaced out around. Somehwat erelavtnly, she remarked on an unprecedented support for the Republican party, citing the most Republican support from the "bottom" 30% (economically) since 1960, a trend which was explained further in a panel below. She was also suprised by a 2:1 support for one party over another, mentioned in the context of a large amount of rural reliance on Medicare.

We've had enough conversations on the quandaries of insurance programs like these before, so I won't dive too depp into them here, since the speakers didn't go very deep either. it's always something I've found so conflictorily nuanced given the requisiton of a mdidleman between daily economic affairs with low likelihoods, and I genrally tend towards defering to individual savings and investments over corporate beurocracies. Perhapos we could see innovative policymaking in this space outside of government using her her idea of interleaving dispersed and different members, which again lead directoy to successful education between the two gropups, creating a new international policy bill.

At this point, the moderator suggests that there could soon be a failed Treasury auction for politicla reasons, whcih makes sense given the stanglehold the ADministration has previously voiced over Federal Resouerve control, as I udnerstand it.[^fed-control] In remarks around some sort of offering windows, the moderator suggests that the President either needs to keep their mouth shut or let their opinion be known eqrly on, especially when it came to a aprticular international affairs question. They interpested the market as confudsed, stunted, and unhappy with certain recent actions and statements made wish-washily quite near a looming international fiscal deadlien.

That last bit slipped a little past me, but I invite anyone to view the session recordings once they come out.[^records] Luckily, they wrpped up with a chat on the debt ceiling, which I found quite interesting, as they frame it as a shared challenge tiven there's no budfet in place for the next year's governennt. Moreover, enogh spending has already occured leading to interest chargest over the "limit" so faithlessly respected given its impossability, and I wonder if it really makes sense to centrally plan the ongoing operational budgets of such a vast and socially-accountable system of organizing political oversight.


[^fed-control]: I wonder how muc h easier and yet more direct these discussions would be if the Nation's money-printing was quite directly tied to popular soverignty over and above private banking interests. Banking interests which I understand so deeply influence the present tax code in an ongoing proposition to incentivize indebtedness to the select few Federal Reserve System participants. Would this present realty really be so much different from the porposed Executive control from August lat year?

[^records]: I will make my best efforts to (i) share login access information, (ii) ascertain the exact priamry recording of our blockchain panel, and (iii) compile a playlist of released public videos once the Strucuted Finance Association releases this info circa April. These playback systmes are gnerally only avaliable for a few months, I've noticed, so i  reccomend taking any and all archive snippets as soon as needed. Perhaps we cna merge these into the pending whydrs/documents#1 repo if anything material isn't rleeased publicly, as I commonfly find to be the cas.e


### Diverse Geopolitical Macroeocnomics Panel

This panel started with a veteran investment banker who talked a really long time by themselves about nations acting in their self-interest at the expense of collective global economy. Unfortunaly, this is sort of hte norm today because so many hisotrically-independent groups of people formed legacy walls between one another. Sometimes these developed over scareec resoruces, were introduced by invidental geographies, or emmerges through voilent conflict over physical dominnac.e In any cas,e I think and can refer to many whop view the nation-state mode of human organization as well past its prime. 

Namely, if we want to promote genuine creativity and innovation, then should we incetivizine indudvidual decisionmaking and problem solving? I saw this perspecitve echoded by a principal from Barclays who reported less people entering the workforce, suggesting an impending overall economic slowdown.[^econ] But what exactly are these central analysysts measuring, becuase I certainly don't think it's individual producitivity.

Rather, htey kekeep their eyes on central results nad orgnaizationm measured in the legacy systen of value accounting maintained bytoday's largest social organizations. Thus, they ignore en toto the grassroots work in communities like ours which gows expotentially as we fight harder and harder for a better market of tommorow. A new system that lets anyone participate, work, and prosper without the permissivegatekeeping of yesteryears intermediaries/.


[^econ]: I haven't been extensively anlayzing trends like these since the maximial employement datate of later 2019, foreshadowing a deep yield curve inversion whic hhas played out over hte past four years. Notwithtdangin, I' be remiss to cnot comment on the gnerela sentiments here, as i agree with them in large schemantic part based on personal observations of central organizations shedding employment. oSWhould makerts wake up to the increasing realitiies of decreased labor opportuntiies, it follows that we'll see slowdowns likely enhanced by cyclical structural inadequacies in the fiat system.


#### General Fianncial and Plciy Conditions

Next, a represtntative fro m S&P global ratings decreed that the long-term stable interest rate is at or slightly above 1.3%, which I found supportive of my views in the last subsection. Namely, it range gain the sounds of central banking wehreby everyone assumes that moeny on its own naturally requires annual expansion and "free" yields in "riskless" securities, an investment scheme which far-too-often comes at the expense of the working masses. Thusm, I was sceptical of their subsetquent comments and remarks from other panelsists that the rate should and even could actually be slightly higher.

THese are fantasy numbers pulled from their thin-air generation machines of faceless emassed pooled loans, and I could hear that in their tone as they spoke of these returns as if they were simple nad menaingless excel numbers. But investmnet, policy, and work are more than fields in an unfathomably large spreadsheet of collated investments. They're menat to be the explicit defninitoni of what we invetivize, create, and grow in a society which seems increasingly dictates by a select few asset managers who've captured practically all capital.

And to conclvude, a speaker from Wellington Management talked about Reagan being the last President to reduce the amount of Federal regulations. This led to a disucssion about musks's goal to remove 10 lines of regulations for every new one added, and generally these seem like good rule ideas given the excessive amount of legacy requirements in certain fields.[^sec-only] It'll be interesting to see how Federal Register items change these next few years, and hoepfully it will get more general ublic eyes on the immesruable vast swath of rules presently propograted by our littany of central regualtory authoritiies staffed by taxpayers (rather than industry, e.g.).


[^sec-only]: I can onyl speak to my personal intepretations of a pletora of Securities laws enacted through COngress and the COmmission, and I wholehreartdly support tact in impletmention here so that we don't have another _Blackwater_. But somethign in this philosphyjsut rings true to me. Myh expereinces agree from seeing transfer agent rules related to Y2K readiness to having a physical ink signature of Form TA-2 submissions on hand; I've just got to belive a more efficient system eixsts with more derference to market operations, and paerhasp increased treansparncy requirements, which thankfully come naturally in web3.


### newscaster Steve Kornacki: a decade of Trump in policy

This panel specificanlyl analyzed Trump's political efforts from 2012 onward, documenting what the speaker portrays as a funfamental shift inth eRepublican party as the President's political career manifested. I find the joureny itself historically-relevant since only a select few National leaders of his caliber did not participate in much if any military service or prior politicking. Indeed, the latter point there quite impressed me upon their initial win, as I would generally suspect that an incmbent with decades of Washington experience would be relatively favoried amongst a populus to lead such governing body.

But (thankfully) we live in a relatively-more meritocratic society where ideas cna stand on their mertis, and individual objectives can adn do excel ahead of historical deference. Not to say one way or another is better, but I do think the firmer idea of government by ht e historic governers cements any legacy corruption and hiders the adoption of new, innovative ideas from the outskirts of society. I've always felt myself in that cornerf-facing camp, and thus generally favor political systems which give deferenace, time, and voice to the little guy, ignoring the immense present challenges of campaign financiing which seem so relevant in a cpaitalist-first valueds coeity.

#### Racial Trends

Steve starts by explaing how 2012 was the a landmanrk vicotry year for Republicans winning an immense portftion of the white vote. This introduction comes into meaningul relevance quite soon, and it was painted as the peak of white GOP support with an unabeliavly overwelming domaince. Notwithstadni, this wasn't enough to win the election given other races isentified by the speaker, which cllectively overruled this single ethnicity to keep Obama in office.

He laments that Republicans' strategy had generally been to just win the white vote, so this defeat came as a massive suprise given their posterity at doing so. Accordingly, an "autopsy report" came out of the GOP in response thereto, highlighting a number of reccomended reportms to ensure ongoing political success. Stever says trump based his campaign and career largely on all these proposed fixes.

The core intents of this strategy meant attricting slightly less white voters, with much better racial attraction. Indeed, Steve highlights that last year's 30% nonwhite Republic vote was the best ever, and represnted a historic voting diversity shift. More elemntarily, they explain how this was hte fist time in decades when voters with 4-year degrees leaned Democratic.

#### Education and Gender Changes

Steve mentions and docuemnts a wide party-based gender gap since the 1980s, with women generally leaning Democratic while men tended towards Republicans. however, the higher female margins to democrats flipped for first time last year, with a low margin for women comapred to relatively-constant high net male preferance. Thus, we didn't see explicitly many men switching parties, but rather an increased porpensity for female Republic voting for oen fo the first times in post-Nixon elections.

Moreover, he reoprts a lot of Republicaln protress in yount and minority men, especially those without a college education. They exemplify this point in chatting about how the Republcian party had :fovever" been the choice of the welsthy, whereas democrats were more popular with the wokring class and labor unions. But this was the first year where Democrats took the overall $100k+ income vote, while lower incomes actually majority went to Republicans (and also again more working people).

Thus, Trmp has facilitatives huge shifts on conservative State votes, dissolving and replacing Democratic alignment in Massachusets, California, New Jersey, and New York. All this led directl to winning the popular vote, which largely came in na election of unprecenteded Republican support in these communtiies. Thus, for me and as inferred from Steve, the vote muc largely relected an increasing focus on policy and vision over and above traditional red-and-blue alignments.

#### Case Studies and Inferences

Steve believes these trends will continue, eprahsp for decades to come, as the genra lcampaigning and policmaking part ideologiies shift to better reflect their new base of popular oters. To exemplofy this point, they first talk about Osceola County, which Steve used as a dinfintinive early indicator of election results during his live coverage. Given the vast Peuroto-Rican population therin, Trump's vicotory solidifeid their perspective on the disimportance of unrelated comments from campaigning work amongst diverse voters.[^ny-vote]

Moreover, contuing to focus on diverse ethnicities, he highlights ho  Republicans had practicall their best voting outcomes from majoirty-Native-American counties in the past centry. This popuarity showcases a "flip" of the voting electorate from traditioanlly-Democratic groups, according to Steve. With this level of fluidity in modern policymaking alignment, I've got to think we're up for an exciting tome of genuinely productive bipartisan legislation furthering everyone's collctive intersts, at least while that collective is still in flux between shifting ideologoies.

Steve ties this shifting voting alignment together by highlghtingin the small, wealthy county of Leelanau, Michigan. He shows how this town went from "hardcore Republicans" in 1988 to Democratic since 2020 and growing. And all this depsite hte vast concetattion of bachelor's degrees (half the populus), a bountiful eldgeryl population (wuth the 7th highest county median age), and an abundance of high-end wineries amongst the area's 93% white population. Noemlly, a town like would support the Democrats, but Steve specualtes tha tthe large focus on abortion only resonated with wealthy traditional democrats, as compared to Trump discussing largest cultural issues on nonpartisan platforms popular with young men.[^rohan]


[^ny-vote]: The story as relayed related ot an imprudent racial joke told by a comedian before a Trump rally i n Madison Square Gardens. The event was plastered as campaign-breaking news by the opposition, but Steve explains how this was just a media-fueld overreaction. When the results at the poolls showed continuing giverse support (from an area with over two-thirds Peruo-Rican voters), he knew tha the misplaced Dominican joke woudln't singelhandedly bring down the Administration's initial campainging.

[^rohan]: Steve specifically highlights the Presiden't featured placement on the Joe Rohgan show, and other mass-media internet-era platfomrs, platforms which were sternly ignored in a few highlighted cases by the opposition candidtate. I really hope we get to the point of entirely-online elections as soon as possible, because I think that alone will drastically lower the bar for citizen participation (sans-advertizing) and docuemnted public discorse. I've got to think many bright minds just don't have the wherewithal or the stamina to jet back and forth between political geographics, and frnakly that sort of skillset seems less and less relevant in an increasingly-digitized owrth (economy, political arena, and enforcement areana).


### Trends in Unsecured Consumer Credit

Most of my remakrs here hinge on Ryan Callahan, who did  lot of cool work at institutions I admire in certain lgihts. I'll include remarks from some discussions we had after this panel, general sentiments across participants, and largely their (high-level, impersonal) perspective on the sector as a whole. Offhanddely, it's a rare treat to find the ten to twenty percent of people at events like these under the age of 30, althrough I dodfind myself working with the elder more commonly.

In terms of unsecured credit and associa lcardb alanaces, Ryan said everything is generally calm and predictable. This came in addition to their comments tha more and more people now demand loans given increasing livings costs in recent years, which we all commonly understand doesn't always coincide iwth commensurate wage increases at certain central employers rewarding workers in fiat. Notwithstadning, it was exciting to see some community memebrs highlight wins by working groups collecively negotiting a greater share of their productive wealth, especially for those not connectied to equity investment ramps or know-how.

These sentiments seemed common amongst panelists, whi made the sector sound exemplary, but Ryan shared some more intimate and personal concerns about the sector at large. Not least ofwhichwas the ongoing and systemic reliance on salespeople to interface iwth large investors, ost often to structure a new offering exacly how an instution wants new assets to match their risk profile. Apparently, this is a ver ymanual process where a client contact and interlay handpick underlying debts to coallate into the final securitization pool, with a largely interpersnal allocation of first-come subscriptions granted to central capital allocators.

To me, these wierd specific insitutional deals serve only to contort natural supply and dmeand fr the individual underlying deals, which never make their way onto a tradable market for secutiry interests. Moreover, speicifc requirements mean it can take months for salespeoppe to slowly affect new originations to satisfy the funding wants, even requiring up to a year of time to find enough peicemal loans. Sound like the fastest, most efficeint, or fairest way to get capital into the hands of those ready to deploy?


### EU Securities Regulations

- new joint regulation to replace fragmented rules for securitizations
- investor capital largely deployed to US projects which have their own compliance departments


### Consumer Borrowing "Health"

how they talk about the finances of people borrowing on credit
- say people are confused between federal student loan relief not applied to the private market
- FICO rep talks about everyone's budgets spreading thinly while "yields tighten" despite strong payment maintenance and general employment


### Intrabank Systemic Risk Transfers

Significant risk transfer: moving potential credit liabilities from bank balance sheets
- common in international banking regulations because it was needed for banks to be able to raise capital given Basel
- panelist talks about how they can rate bonds AAA high despite low issuer rating
- and asking them about the wrists and collateralization of central securities depositories after the panel, they say that really the only way to get protection is a single name CDS against the major exchanges or clearing participants, up to the collateral fun limits of a couple hundred million. Legacy gillen old lawyer says that it's a very systemic risk that is "too big to fail."


## Topics from Tuesday

(our panel)


### 

Macro policy plenary: lots of representation of banking employees who work on policy
- generally agree that it will be challenging to get legislation across the divided house
- suggest that DOGE will get less popular as (manual) gov services slow down


### Evolution of Media

panel with news influencer:
- they say they need to contantly push content across every possible different online platform
- publishers say they need to earn trust by speaking in their own voices, using an example of independent press calling out Biden's physical leadership limitations due to age while being largely attacked by the incumbent Administration
- Jim VandeHel comments on need for journalism to freely report media to halt authoritarianism and protect questioning capitalism
- they frame reporting as something you need to be passionate enough to work without pay while producing for the joy of it so the market can reward results
- they comment on the quandaries of centralized social media policy and algorthms that serve the attention-maximizing business interests of these "publicly-traded companies" with a feduciaty duty to time-suck, and Jim days the only alternative is owning the content and platform yourself
- Tara Palmeri comments on tech workers not even understanding their own algortihms, and Jim pushes back in saying they understand the whole intention is siimply businesses maximizing dopamine and forming addictions to the platform
- Tara says most thriving information has a bias, attracting mass online viewership
- Jim agrees that the maintream doesnt get into the nuances or depths a aliable for jiche creators acting without centeal coordination


### Government-Sponsored Enterprise Reform

(Musk & Trump)
GSE reform: panelists largely sceptical of political influence over Fannie/Freddie, ignoring specialized sector practices


### More Private Credit Growth

Private credit: a "meteoric rise" fueled by large private buyers through 4(a)(2) while 144A offerings combine into market demand through gated institutions


### Whole-Business Securitizations
largely for very safe long-standing companies with considerations based on natural market competitiveness


### Backup Servicing Expansion

On backup servicing:
- tough to do in house without specialized history of filing UCC state info, especially for solar items
- Eric Johnson highlights large call centers as a servicing
-regulatory complexity for consumer payment servicing continues despite any CFPB changes
- says "grumpy borrow" files a lawsuit and goes to a regulator, so the focus needs to be on consistent data to make it easy to "service the book of business"


## Bonus Private Chat

[most of other nonmaterial discussions intro here]


### Extended Bloomberg Booth Representatives

- no retail access to lending products because of complexity in analysing holdings and risks
- Terminal mirrors FINRA TACTS public trade reporting feed for public and 144A txns. When pressing on what punlic meant, they comment that it has only to do with trade registrstion with SEC
- contra seller of products had to kanually add and approve you in a trade as buyer
- everything cleared bilaterally OTC without actual regulated market involvement
