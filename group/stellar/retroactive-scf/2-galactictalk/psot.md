basically we have a 

stupid
- based on waiting 12 months (https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1124340476288454657/1431195444616101969)

and

dumb
- you can literally just spam random votes lol

way people ramp up into becoming a pilot (and able to vote nqg weight)

so like i know its harder to tally but id rather have a million votes with weight . 001 which are then completely (not ist ish here) ignored 

basically lowering the bar to even get in the cockpit

then there is the idea of 'social consequences' for asking to vote / delegate:
COMPLETELY DEVOID & SEPARATE from one's ability to allocate capital
