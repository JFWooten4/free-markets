Hello hello!

This post responds preliminarily to points [brought up](https://github.com/JFWooten4/notes/blob/ebbcd987f9239b28ec5cbdf9830a4bc08637ceb6/2025/Jul/11.md)  last SCF sSturcuutre meeting. I asked for a public palce to submit efforts, and after some contempaltion I couldn;t think of a better placed to writge than this exceptionally ujnderappreciated repo!

All around some excpetional work here from @silence48 in #1.[^cf-next] ðŸŽ‰ Sincerely cannot wait to see what comes out of the brewing pot next from @ankeliu and team,

### Upgraded Visuals

Speakign of , I'd like to highlighht to aweosme new "delegate activity graph" within the Dashboard. Exceptional look with the crystal-clear  transprencyh reminiscne t of Stellar Atlas prototyping:

All these devleopments are incredible to say the least, and I really can't wait to see more workk published.[^legacy-data] If there's anythign I've noticed working with SDF changemakrers it's immense tecchnical dedication.

### Continuing Exccellence

That's why I've been mapping out the application of NQG to  our [nonprofit  ocmmunity](https://www.whydrs.org/the-first-duna) since its ignenous incenption and publcciation.  I  cna't  think  of  a better testing-fogunds "in the fire" of Symbal and reputational attacks than the communtiy fund.[^asets!]

[^joahn0ask]: 

[^round-37]

[^round-37]: Navigator progression stalling on time-0basis with strange inclusion of delegation

[^cf-next]: I'm not sure what the plans hare "behind the scenes" with gettign tghis merged and bringing other communtiy -fund assets online throught the gituhub. I d appreciate that it's eaier to "fmove fast" with a closely-held agenda, but I beleive in collective intelligence when it  comes to our shared sftware.

[^legacy-data]: And to see tall this despite some legacy [migration  constraints](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1124340476288454657/1264660553138176032). I can only hypothesize how much time everyone spends in AirTable.

[^asets!]: I'm an asset managemtn guy  forged from the depths fo caitalist markets. That's why my main indicators of systemic competaence revovle aroudn total funds secured and distributed  by systems.
