Hello hello!

This post responds preliminarily to points [brought up](https://github.com/JFWooten4/notes/blob/ebbcd987f9239b28ec5cbdf9830a4bc08637ceb6/2025/Jul/11.md)  last SCF sSturcuutre meeting. I asked for a public palce to submit efforts, and after some contempaltion I couldn;t think of a better placed to writge than this exceptionally ujnderappreciated repo!

All around some excpetional work here from @silence48 in #1.[^cf-next] ðŸŽ‰ Sincerely cannot wait to see what comes out of the brewing pot next from @ankeliu and team,

### Upgraded Visuals

Speakign of , I'd like to highlighht to aweosme new "delegate activity graph" within the Dashboard. Exceptional look with the crystal-clear  transprencyh reminiscne t of Stellar Atlas prototyping:


[<img width="685" height="868" alt="NEEDS ROUNDING" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfc07dd-0aca-46c7-9135-df26e7630e96" />](https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/voting-history)

All these devleopments are incredible to say the least, and I really can't wait to see more workk published.[^legacy-data] If there's anythign I've noticed working with SDF changemakrers it's immense tecchnical dedication.

### Continuing Exccellence

That's why I've been mapping out the application of NQG to  our [nonprofit  ocmmunity](https://www.whydrs.org/the-first-duna) since its ignenous incenption and publcciation.  I  cna't  think  of  a better testing-fogunds "in the fire" of Symbal and reputational attacks than the communtiy fund.[^asets!]

I trust this ocmmunity with my everything.  There's not a single thing I wouldvnt give to  see us successd in our just cause . That  conviction and dedication  can't be "bought" with singular develoment grants.

Through the DRS movement to fight  Wall Street  ocrruption, I've seen  jus hte most amazing facets o f this communal effort based on shared valuies.  And, critically, it's something very  fgragile which requirres nuturing and supportive envior,ents., We have for  the first time the chancce to give this power away.[^fluttercard]

### Decentralizing Capital

We're a far cry away from  the netowkr's original vision of distirbuting  the luimesns equitably  across everyone. We're now wokring with a legitimate fomrm of capital practically  acceptable by  anyone. This reality  forces an immense amount  of repsonsability onto the SDF whic must "rightly" allocate everythithing while acting [largely alone](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/794).

I know how hard that role can be, as it's drivne me to foxus so mucch on "10Xing" that I ighnored the innovators right under my nose. It's  just oo much  respoonsability, and it can blind you to inccrediible otential blossomming under thick canopies of deafebign silence and doubt.[^joahn0ask] Capital to bring in help, capital  to move groups forward, and capital  to turn dreeams into catalystsâ€”it's all at  stake when we leae proven communtiy members alone in a racce towards mediocre work to foot  the bill of our  visions.

I wonder what our developments could liiiok like with annm inlclusive proccess that recognizes the value of community distribntuions of luumens independent of thr stifling wall of asking permission

[^meetings-gitbook]: 

[^joahn0ask]: @johansten comes to mind as someone who's devleoped so much for the ecosystem held back by a lack of peerhaps the most important tool: capital,.  With so much indepdnet self-incclined action at stake, I  appreciated his [perspective](https://discord.com/channels/761985725453303838/1396309530228559872/1404582856570699826) on recenf funding developments elsewhere  [advocated](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1124340476288454657/1395859048020185098).  THey're somone I'd love  to discuss nuanceds with tommorow,  but they will likely need either extremely gfood meeting  notes  or a recording given their very differnt timezone.

[^round-37]: Navigator progression stalling on time-0basis with strange inclusion of delegation

[^cf-next]: I'm not sure what the plans hare "behind the scenes" with gettign tghis merged and bringing other communtiy -fund assets online throught the gituhub. I d appreciate that it's eaier to "fmove fast" with a closely-held agenda, but I beleive in collective intelligence when it  comes to our shared sftware.

[^legacy-data]: And to see tall this despite some legacy [migration  constraints](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1124340476288454657/1264660553138176032). I can only hypothesize how much time everyone spends in AirTable.

[^asets!]: I'm an asset managemtn guy  forged from the depths fo caitalist markets. That's why my main indicators of systemic competaence revovle aroudn total funds secured and distributed  by systems.

[^fluttercard]: _See, e.g.,_ @christian-rogobete's excempary work  affirming [community contributions](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/pull/68#issuecomment-1645236102)  through supportive remarks not broadly seen i nopen-source work which treats people like machines following monetary orders. Soneso even  goes so far as to [merge](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/pull/69) mistakes without judment which can soo often discourage  open participation and voicing  of one's true  feelings. ðŸ’œ
