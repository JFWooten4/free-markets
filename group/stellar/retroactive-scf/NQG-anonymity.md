I want basis from https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1124340476288454657/1393851637256290334 at https://github.com/JFWooten4/notes/tree/main/2024/Jul/19  

We have narrative:  
- Doxxing as a form of trusted group acceptance  
- Applauding removal of required referral to _begin_ NSQWG weight acquisition  
  - Start without permission through story of going between Silence and Phil  
  - Transition towards _capital allocation_ through voting weight as project specialization  
  - Independent deferrals rather than blanket requisite horseshit  
- We are hence encompassing the trust aspects of SCP in known passion and reputational stake,  
- Truly independent money managers as staggeringly differential efficiency compared to the legacy central bureaucrats in re "relationships" from the standard corporate narrative (connected DIRECTLY with the denseness of the SDF as showcased by https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/issues/1552)

### Public voting  

Needed to make informed delegations  

Delegation to anke authority given expertise  

Really ride her ass up high!  

Then we have and need deference to single eg of freelance experience at [[[href of ppt explaining how I wanted logo designed, didn’t see in any of the canvas]]]  

# Interim Narrative  

Given the recent genius act news and the SDF's active public involvement therewith, I believe it’s due time to contemplate the forum of ongoing grants.  

Challenge in the central structure within the Discord  

Cool I guess for like the entrenched in-group  

Not awesome for an analysis of competence  

(Can come back to the sentiment there)  

If continuing, we need prep more reg  

That means more scrutiny of $
