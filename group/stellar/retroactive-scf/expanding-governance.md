```

## Context

The present submission panel for the public goods award goes through three SDF individuals, which is centralized. I want to get us on track to expand power over common Foundation-run assets. This starts with bringing the ecosystem into the loop for co-adancement discussions over and above validator votes.

## Body

 I think the qualit of feedback on CPAs matters a lot, sine the commitee is the last line of reveiw before validator implementaion. Whether we like it or not, the arhcival inconcensitienies showcase general defferment to CAOs that make it through review. The original post sai "starting with SDF's resperetation" as per hte idea of "evolv[int] the CAP process" to presumabl include agents outside of the FOundation, which I think good great idea.

 I've discussed this with prominent community members, and flatly I do not believe this htree-perosn group will consisitnely chose quality over speed {CHECK HE}. Tomer dismissed my oncerns over the Protocol 20 bug, but that call was  overruled by a quorum that may no longer exist in public documentation with this change . Complete power in the hands of FOundation members just doens't make sense to me given the realtive uniformity of voiewpoints.

 Blokchsin should not update such critical govenrmance mechanisms [within 3 hours](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1792) of porposal based on the response of one email. {?} Might it be owrth spending omre than a few days approivng these changes to receive enhanced written feedback fomr exceptional communtiy members like Tim Baker or Johan St√©n? I've risked m entire career n the decnetralization of the network as a requisite to trade securities; should we really settle for entire upgrades in dy.

ICYMI: Monday, we plan to release a new version of Stellar Core that patches a bug with state archival (the bug is currently quarantined; this will fix the underlying issue).

We plan to upgrade Testnet Tuesay, and to schedule a Mainnet upgrade vote for Wendesday.

{{ rem change the silence call }}
but her will lead us into a fault if we don't expand the perview of review efforts before they hit a network vote, . .. The votes are lopsidingly dominated, as shown in NQG_FROUND_1_DECAY_TO_2 and SDF_BLOG_POST_DISARMING_BUG_V1_UPGRADE
