## Context

The present submission panel for the public goods award goes through three SDF individuals, which is centralized. I want to get us on track to expand power over common Foundation-run assets. This starts with bringing the ecosystem into the loop for co-adancement discussions over and above validator votes.

The votes are lopsidingly dominated, as shown in NQG_FROUND_1_DECAY_TO_2 and SDF_BLOG_POST_DISARMING_BUG_V1_UPGRADE
