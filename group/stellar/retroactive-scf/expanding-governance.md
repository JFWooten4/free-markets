Status: Draft
Submit: 20 Oct 2025
Dialog: https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/ZmlSKP1HoDc

## Context

The present submission panel for the public goods award goes through three SDF individuals, which is centralized. I want to get us on track to expand power over common Foundation-run assets. This starts with bringing the ecosystem into the loop for co-advancement discussions over and above validator votes.

I think the quality of feedback on CPAs matters a lot, since the committee is the last line of review before validator implementation. Whether we like it or not, the archival inconsistencies showcase general deferment to CAOs that make it through review. The original post said "starting with SDF's representation" as per the idea of "evolving the CAP process" to presumably include agents outside of the Foundation, which I think is a great idea.

I've discussed this with prominent community members, and flatly I do not believe this three-person group will consistently choose quality over speed {CHECK HE}. Tomer dismissed my concerns over the Protocol 20 bug, but that call was overruled by a quorum that may no longer exist in public documentation with this change. Complete power in the hands of Foundation members just doesn't make sense to me given the relative uniformity of viewpoints.

Blockchain should not update such critical governance mechanisms [within 3 hours](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1792) of proposal based on the response of one email. {?} Might it be worth spending more than a few days approving these changes to receive enhanced written feedback from exceptional community members like Tim Baker or Johan StÃ©n? I've risked my entire career on the decentralization of the network as a requisite to trade securities; should we really settle for entire upgrades in a day.

No way to be certain of code obvious because it was made by humans as per Justin.
_We_ do everything possible.
PAST

PRES
ICYMI: Monday, we plan to release a new version of Stellar Core that patches a bug with state archival (the bug is currently quarantined; this will fix the underlying issue).

We plan to upgrade Testnet Tuesday, and to schedule a Mainnet upgrade vote for Wednesday.

Basis here in very small amount with DRQ "a little goes a long way" is a signal I use frequently in keto recipes. It helps bind together otherwise disparate ingredients _with a common stabilizer_. Might we use a new ingredient like this to keep us solid?

'Carpetbagged resistance to change' needs discredit IFASIK.

Re supporting bugs and shipping features quickly???

Dissociated Tomerâ€™s
And can think of only a few other equally competent leaders at the Foundation's review helm.

~~But her will lead us into a fault~~ if we don't **expand the purview of review efforts** before they hit a network vote.

'Software has bugs BS.'

Archival pipeline (evict â†’ archive â†’ later auto-restore) logic flaw.
Use base back from internal audit and consults.

Before the network vote part is the key control frame. 
The votes are lopsidedly dominated, as shown in [NQG_FROUND_1_DECAY_TO_2](https://testnet.governance.script3.io/CAAZC6VH23GNNY4YVWULS7UJ5EQEMZJ4ZBH4UMU76KVTUJD7NXQPPBQM/proposal/?id=8) and [SDF_BLOG_POST_DISARMING_BUG_V1_UPGRADE which is also the next day lol](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/our-decision-to-disarm-validators-and-vote-to-postpone-the-protocol-20-upgrade).

### Power

The timeline is all I care about.

- Deployment on Friday down to Wednesday, ~~a weekend a+~~
- TODOs in CAP76 three days before network upgrade deployment

My regulated world. I do not trust him to take quality over adoption. I believe a year first step.

24-hour turnaround on 62 and 66.
