```

## Context

The present submission panel for the public goods award goes through three SDF individuals, which is centralized. I want to get us on track to expand power over common Foundation-run assets. This starts with bringing the ecosystem into the loop for co-adancement discussions over and above validator votes.

I love tomeer (but not prhased like that) and can thing of only a few other equally-competatnt leaders at the Foudnation's review helm, but her will lead us into a fault if we don't expand the perview of review efforts before they hit a network vote, . .. The votes are lopsidingly dominated, as shown in NQG_FROUND_1_DECAY_TO_2 and SDF_BLOG_POST_DISARMING_BUG_V1_UPGRADE

FROM JUSTING:

ICYMI: Monday, we plan to release a new version of Stellar Core that patches a bug with state archival (the bug is currently quarantined; this will fix the underlying issue).

We plan to upgrade Testnet Tuesay, and to schedule a Mainnet upgrade vote for Wendesday.

That means we are asking you to move quickly, install the new version of Stellar Core, and arm your validator for the vote in the window of time between release and upgrade.

Please be ready!  We'll share instructions and links here as soon as they're ready. 

For now, you can read more in this blog post:
