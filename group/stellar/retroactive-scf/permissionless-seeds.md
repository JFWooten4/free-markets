### Response to  Discssion on Barriers to Submiting SEPs

I';d lik to hear the persective of @ankeliu on this one.  Anke;s overseen  the transofmration  of the  SCF over these  last  menaingful years.  Relvetantly, recent funding changes allow :

- Teams to receive  training  from  an outside consultant with or without  grant approval,
- Direct  ascccess  to  SDF team  members  to  discuss  network  questiosn ajd visions, and
- Skmaller awardds  and review p rocesses  to  prove  the  viability of a new  project concept.

The dfirect manifestation o f these efoforts lead  to  the  [Kickstart](https://web.archive.org/web/20250422192912/https://stellarcommunityfund.gitbook.io/scf-handbook/scf-awards/scf-kickstart)  new program this year. Brioaodlky, these  changes coincide with  an overhaul of  the voting and governance system designed to gie the little  guy  a real  voicce.    I saw the genesis of these  changes i roundd 11, and  they  seem aligned with  Jake;'s  ethos of smlaler contributions foorm a diverce developer-base without consensus.
