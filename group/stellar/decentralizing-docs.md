Hi @silence48, thank you for the thoughtful review of that last js example draft! It's been an inspiring week per some stellar feedback from regulators and community developments. Working on those likely till Sunday, and I'll be back to respond to the specifics early next week. 🤝📅

As I'm writing this, I see someone out my window mowing yards on a riding lawn mower which must cost at least $5,000. Indeed, this professional works only to mow lawns and offer other such yardwork in the area. It's this longstanding specialization that enables expottential social progress, progress which can [too easily](https://teapowered.dev/posts/demoralization-capitalism/) be haulted by monopolization.

It's in this context that I ask if we might further advocacte for specialized open-source work? Namely, it's [our understanding](https://github.com/orgs/WhyDRS/discussions/1) that true sustainability for community members like yourself to just [do stellar work](https://tyler.yak.farm/personal-ZS5pWDdaYXZHeHVqUEZ3aGpPWmNRczl1bEhrYnZpejNJMm15cnQ1a3l1eXMxTjlLY05qYQ/how-to-make-more-money-c3dGbU81RVBPQVprT1BHU2FUY2xI) and receive fair compensation. It's in this context that I'd appreciate the opportunity to share some thoughts on decentralizing our documentation, the very tool which widely introduced me to Stellar in the first place.[^cb]

# Background

Your brief review points bring up some material background which seem relevant in the context of this PR and other discussions or issues previously referencing it. Accordingly, might I sharte my overarching throughts about the specific items you brought up? 💬 SNamely, I am not and do not consider myself to be a coder. 

All of the production applications I've wetritten are in Pyhton, which is why I mapped out the basic premise like that first. After that, I'm onto ChatGPT and such to translate the info as requested. 👩‍💻 I think there are some challenges on that side because it doesn't seem to understand how go account address resolution works&mdash;something I understand you've actually trained a model around for more accurate results in all languages.

Like other community embers, I am much more of a writer and strategist, outside of my true call in asset management. And I belive these educational skillsets are crucial to widespread aoption of the network. Given the sunsetting of SCF education grands `by my present understanding`, might I share some more thoughts on the documentation, governance, and progress of Stellar? 🌌

# An Abundant Network Opportunity

I think you more than anyone have seen firsthand just how creative our communiy can be given adequate resources. Particularly, it's my understanding that many projects solicit your consultation because of your active, generous, and timely support on Discord. 💜 The incredible reality of this work is that it enables specialization, a tool so crucial to efficiecnt capitlist society.

## Fostering Directness

Indeed, most of the challenges in this particular example come from an unfinished draft incorporating the AI response into the page. However, I ran out of time that night, and just 'saved' my progress with an incomplete comit, per the added line spacing seperation. 💾 In fact, I was quite struggling with the inheritence part, as that's something I've always had a tough time with in javascript.

That's why I really appreciate your impromptu review...

## Efficiency for the Impoverished

Low net worth is a temporary status, and I'm obsessed with how we might empower masses of people to change that state via Stellar. Yesterday I was looking to schedule some flights back home/to family for holidays&mdash;[Thanksgiving](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-15-23/s71523-301019-767522.pdf#page=11) in particualr. I needed to confirm some times iwth my partner and such, so I waited till this morning to buy the tickets since she was at work. 

But when I went back to secure my flight, the price for one leg increased by 80% just this morning. Comparatively, avaiation [used to be](https://lnns.co/o1pmTaZBF2_) regulated down to a specific cost per mile, so as to promote equal access opportunities.[^air] Without an efficeint American rail system, I'll indeed be at the whims of the oiligopoilies of how much of my rent savings go towards this particular trip, albeit at my fault partially for not confirming some family event dates earlier.

Thankfully, Stellar seems to fall on the more considerate side of this scale. INdeed, it's the dramatic [efficiency](https://sorobandomains.org/docs/limits_and_fees) baked into [native operations](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1504) which so effortlessly empow the masses to employ the financial system, not the other way around via a [select few middlemen](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1558).[^wallst] I find this particularly inspirational given the precedent of blockchain rent-extrctors copying [major innovations](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) for the sake of short-term profits at the expense of long-term sustainability.

## Shared, Nonproprietary Market Upgrades

I wholeheartedyl belive that only together do we stand a chance at freeing our market's from Wall Street's tight oiligopic grasp. And if we elect to act in unison, it seems like we might just give investors the saving grace htey didn't knwo they needed. Might we act collectvieyl amist this great [turning point](MUST_ACT_NOW_HREF_PER_COMMUINITY) so that the next great financial system doesn't face the [quadnaries of todays](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/1013)?

Indeed, if we are all sincerely "driven by technology that helps people to [truly own what is theirs](https://youtu.be/5wUhyR94rho)," then it seems natural that the network's documentation itself ought live at the whim of [the community](https://discord.gg/stellardev). Do you find this perspective particularly material, given:

> 99% of regular people don’t know that they don’t own a piece of all the companies they’re paying for.
> 
> First they have to understand that, then they have to decide if they prefer convenience or ownership.

## Ownership for All

As inspired by our community an deeply evidend inthe Netowrk's design, might we continue advocating for the foundational promise of usable self-custody? It's my view that this mission starts at the core of our open-source advocacy, advnacements, and accessability. Namely, it's only when changes are [clicks away](SICLENCE_HREF_SMALL_TYPO_FIX_JS_SDK) that the dispersead, imrpoverished, and devellpoing citizens spread across this vast wrold might coherently collaborate towards our grander mission.
