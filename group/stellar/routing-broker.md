[^SCF]: This is a relativeyl centralized service, which I hope we can continue DAO-ifying. Myt largest critiuqe after spendign far too many hours drafting submissions: the centralized nature of explicit defined work items, project budggets, and directive timelines. I applied tfor far too many grants from a wide array of programs early on for Block Transfer in the guise of nonprofit intentions. I saw similar schemes where you'd define excaclty what you wanted funds for, down to the penny in some (governmental) cases. I'm all for the proeper stewardship opf donor funding, but I do not thik this level of direct control best serves the innovrots receiving tech or creative working 


>If the market is truly a public good then it is incumbent on regulators to ensure that it remains stable, fair and orderly, rather than ensuring that exchanges continue to profit from the maker-taker model... The Internet and Open Source efforts have taught us that open systems are nearly always preferable to closed. In that spirit, and under the premise that markets are a public good, market data feeds and tick data history should be opened up... Access to the historical data of direct market data feeds should be made available freely to the public, and a prize-based incentive created for those who can find innovative ways of designing surveillance systems and algorithms.


Yes, agree, 100% liquidity is getting more and more fragmented. It's just the nature of permissionless systems that let anyone build anything. As I posited in the larger post right at the start, I'm not in any way saying we can control what people dpeloy on the network.

In the legal world a company selling trade routing and exchangeservices is regulated by the SEC. It's regulated because, hsitorcally, the profit motive often (if not inevitably) conflicts with investor protectiosn and best execution. Put as simply as I can, why should I sell you apples at  $1 when you're willing to pay $1.05 whereby I keep the extra nickel? That's what the thousands of pages of regulation I work with try to stop companies from introducing into the market.

All this to say,  I see it as a simple hop-skip-jump to becoming the workld;s financial system if we can get the trading systems right, a feat unachieved on any other chains. I can get the regulators on board once we have the throughpuit, and I',m already doign ti without SPEEDEX. We can bring every stock and bond directly to the network and give anyone the opportuntiy to invest directly on the DEX. But this vision becomes expoenntially harder with alteratnive exchange venues outside the standarziation and unionization of the native trading.

if we can get these tokens onbaord the native side, then more anchors should run nodes and offer these serices. But on a higher level, I agree that we need to look deepl yinto abstracting the pathfinding away from user e=decisions. As I understand it, Silence is working on a routing algorthm that takes into account volume impacts on avaliable liquidity. Surely this is realtively simiolar to the work you've done here figurign out the best path to execute a trade. When it comes to a universal DEX implemetned wit independent scaling nodes, I  think we should just let the systme find the best paths. No user choices needed.

Agreed, HOrizon routing is quandarous, especially given the centrality of their instance for a lot of new apps. I appreciate that the SDF truncated thier node history so as to inspure more communtiy particpants, vis-a-vi the validator awards profgram. Once we have more businesses built on the network, the flywheel hopefully kicks this off even cleaner. I'm sure you've throgh a lot about this, and I'd be remiss to not thank Enrique for educating me as to the centralization (-ish) of the current pathfinding on cross-asset paytments.

Perhaps the bumping point here in reachign that goal of a "universal payment system" laregly sits in replacing everyhting underlying present banking infrastructure. Compeltyey support this vision as all the old systms are horrible; I've seen and work with designers thereof firsthand. But there are some very steep incumbency barriers whcih the largest instutitions fight tooth-and-nail to maintain thier monopoly over financial accounts. We've seen this firsthand with the SDF and many community projects like ours in the regulatory space being aggressively debanked.

As for the COinbase chatter, I will say that the sections refderenced and pages associated implicate their noncustodial wallet. There is a lot of interest case law which developed after this particualr Wells Notice which validates quite meaningfully the wokr on exchange which I do. It's not super relevant to the point, but just for posterirtyy I'll add that Stellar is practicallyt hthe most-cited serious chain in decentralized offerings filed through EDGAR.

Replacing the clearinghouses of monetrayr transfers will take gargantuan communal momentaum because of all these mamouth vested interests., It's somethign very big and challenging, which unfortnatly quite few projcts I can think of have made a dent in so far. Honestly, how can you when you need tpo use their centralized on-ramps everywhere outside of the Moneygram integration? And even then, they've denied my own use of that service per preliminary jurisdiction checks.

The changes in CAP38 to work with trustline authoprizations were critically important for regulated assets.

One thing I love abotu SPEEDEX is the eaul execution is gives everyone in trading batches. In my mind, we can apply this same principle to path payments whereby all trades in the block with interleaving execute to maximize total output (like the math here as I understand it). Then we can just give everyone their share of the result based on inputs. Thus, everyone just gets the best rate, becuase why would anyone want a route worse than the best rate?
