[^SCF]: This is a relativeyl centralized service, which I hope we can continue DAO-ifying. Myt largest critiuqe after spendign far too many hours drafting submissions: the centralized nature of explicit defined work items, project budggets, and directive timelines. I applied tfor far too many grants from a wide array of programs early on for Block Transfer in the guise of nonprofit intentions. I saw similar schemes where you'd define excaclty what you wanted funds for, down to the penny in some (governmental) cases. I'm all for the proeper stewardship opf donor funding, but I do not thik this level of direct control best serves the innovrots receiving tech or creative working

Yes, agree, 100% liquidity is getting more and more fragmented. It's just the nature of permissionless systems that let anyone build anything. As I posited in the larger post right at the start, I'm not in any way saying we can control what people dpeloy on the network. But I do think we have a unique ability to incentivize only systems which collectively benefit all users.

The changes in CAP38 to work with trustline authoprizations were critically important for regulated assets. One reason the Soroabn pools are so risky for these applications stems from the lack of support for de-authorizations. I really wish 38 brought with it your pathfinding implementations. It just statrted with a single step of making things work on the compliance side. Now I see it as our responsability to continue developing

However, this is very explicitly not the case with SOroban. Every exchange thereon costs quite materially more than its classic operation counterpart, in ever sense of the term cost. These txns as you know simply cannot scale onchain to the promising paralell throughput of SPEEDEX. Moreover,  the DEX has practically zero fees. TO paraphrase a commentor from Global, it's "

Before diving into the substantive points, I want to again preface by a great fundamental support of all your wookr including this. I greatly appreciated both the sentiments in CAP37 and the surrounding publications advocating interleving. Yes, yes, yes 100% there is nobody else I know of with such stature who'se continually pounded the drum on getting users best execution.

I can get the regulators on board once we have the throughpuit, and I',m already doign ti without SPEEDEX. We can bring every stock and bond directly to the network and give anyone the opportuntiy to invest directly on the DEX. But this vision becomes expoenntially harder with alteratnive exchange venues outside the standarziation and unionization of the native trading.

if we can get these tokens onbaord the native side, then more anchors should run nodes and offer these serices. But on a higher level, I agree that we need to look deepl yinto abstracting the pathfinding away from user e=decisions. As I understand it, Silence is working on a routing algorthm that takes into account volume impacts on avaliable liquidity. Surely this is realtively simiolar to the work you've done here figurign out the best path to execute a trade. When it comes to a universal DEX implemetned wit independent scaling nodes, I  think we should just let the systme find the best paths. No user choices needed.

Agreed, HOrizon routing is quandarous, especially given the centrality of their instance for a lot of new apps. I appreciate that the SDF truncated thier node history so as to inspure more communtiy particpants, vis-a-vi the validator awards profgram.

All this to say,  I see it as a simple hop-skip-jump to becoming the workld;s financial system if we can get the trading systems right, a feat unachieved on any other chains. I can get the regulators on board once we have the throughpuit, and I',m already doign ti without SPEEDEX. We can bring every stock and bond directly to the network and give anyone the opportuntiy to invest directly on the DEX. But this vision becomes expoenntially harder with alteratnive exchange venues outside the standarziation and unionization of the native trading.
As a parallel, the DAO chat outlined at a  very high level how much of the recent devlopments parlllel the development of alternative "mini-stock-exchange" trade orderbooks in the 70s onward./ Here we are five decades later, ad it's extremely clear to our comunity that the tail end of this "decentralized fragmentation" is an abundantly powerful central control over market access, rates, and pathfinding./ When for-profit (centralized or decentralized) groups control these systems, users today gt raked through the mud.

We have somethign so incrdibly close to this ideal of a market that's truly free to all participants. I believe so deeply that we should support this system and built it to its maximum effectiveness and efficienty to remove the need for a revenue stream. I've just seen this destroy the integrity of markets so ghastardly before, and I believe we can truly maintain the core innovations through a combination of distributing the fee pool or inflation rewards to public utitlie
As for the COinbase chatter, I will say that the sections refderenced and pages associated implicate their noncustodial wallet. There is a lot of interest case law which developed after this particualr Wells Notice which validates quite meaningfully the wokr on exchange which I do. It's not super relevant to the point, but just for posterirtyy I'll add that Stellar is practicallyt hthe most-cited serious chain in decentralized offerings filed through EDGAR.
Replacing the clearinghouses of monetrayr transfers will take gargantuan communal momentaum because of all these mamouth vested interests., It's somethign very big and challenging, which unfortnatly quite few projcts I can think of have made a dent in so far. Honestly, how can you when you need tpo use their centralized on-ramps everywhere outside of the Moneygram integration? And even then, they've denied my own use of that service per preliminary jurisdiction checks.
