Hi @silence48, thank you for the thoughtful review of that last js example draft! It's been an inspiring week per some stellar feedback from regulators and community developments. Working on those likely till Sunday, and I'll be back to respond to the specifics early next week. 🤝📅

# Background

Your brief review points bring up some material background which seem relevant in the context of this PR and other discussions or issues previously referencing it. Accordingly, might I sharte my overarching throughts about the specific items you brought up? 💬 SNamely, I am not and do not consider myself to be a coder. 

All of the production applications I've wetritten are in Pyhton, which is why I mapped out the basic premise like that first. After that, I'm onto ChatGPT and such to translate the info as requested. 👩‍💻 I think there are some challenges on that side because it doesn't seem to understand how go account address resolution works&mdash;something I understand you've actually trained a model around for more accurate results in all languages.

Like other community embers, I am much more of a writer and strategist, outside of my true call in asset management. And I belive these educational skillsets are crucial to widespread aoption of the network. Given the sunsetting of SCF education grands `by my present understanding`, might I share some more thoughts on the documentation, governance, and progress of Stellar? 🌌

# An Abundant Network Opportunity

I think you more than anyone have seen firsthand just how creative our communiy can be given adequate resources. Particularly, it's my understanding that many projects solicit your consultation because of your active, generous, and timely support on Discord. 💜 The incredible reality of this work is that it enables specialization, a tool so crucial to efficiecnt capitlist society.

## Fostering Directness

Indeed, most of the challenges in this particular example come from an unfinished draft incorporating the AI response into the page. However, I ran out of time that night, and just 'saved' my progress with an incomplete comit, per the added line spacing seperation. 💾 In fact, I was quite struggling with the inheritence part, as that's something I've always had a tough time with in javascript.

That's why I really appreciate your impromptu review...










Comments in re formalizing policies for regulatory review through transparent protocol amendments.


## context

Here are some places reffering to CAPs as formal specifications

- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/864
- [Sec. 2.1.1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1504)[^symb]
- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1516

## change scopes

I should talk a little on how some CAPs don't present all the XDR changes

## prereq.s

Learn the xdr 😔

[^symb]: Using `§` will probably look more authoritative.
