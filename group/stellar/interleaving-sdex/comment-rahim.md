Hi @rahimklaber,

Thank you for your thoughts, both here and shared on Discord. It was inspiring to hear via DMs how you got into the network, largely for humanitarian/real-world use cases. Over the years, I've found this to be a common thread linking us together.

In an effort to further these foundational principles that uniquely belowng to the network, might I quickly review my own understanding of these ethos? Chiefly, I understand that the founders wanted a decentralized payments network that was cheap, fast, and inclusive based on personal identity, not computing power. We seen uniquely adept to provide such a system given the legarthy, centralization, and gatekeeping present in other financial systems.

I'm writing this as someone who just wants the most efficient technology possible under our stewardship because I've felt so keenly the vast inadequacies of legacy markets for practically my whole life. They have ripped apart my family, taken nearly every drop of opportunity I've identified right out of my hands, and pulverized my aspirations as a mainstream asset manager.[^self] There is nothing I want more than for the network to succeed, and I believe wholeheatedly that we will triumph enormously over other technologies given the proper execution of scalable, decentralized, egalitarian markets. ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèø


[^self]: This is not a reply about myself, but I just want to share my openly-disclosed "stake at the table." I have aproximately $3,000 in both my checking account and Roth IRA; everything else is in [john.xlm](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GC5TUPFLOXCINDYHQVYYLLVYP6GKHT65ELB2Q2WLFTGN63YYIXPQTDFJ). I sold the vast majority of my assets three years ago for [$30,000](WHYDRS_TRADING_HREF_T), which I've been using to build the stock market on Stellar ever sense.

# 1. Extensive Recent Community Actions

Since this post, quite the collective discussion has popped up on the subject. Perhaps most relevantly, you were rightly given accolades for uncover in the deadly bug.[^yays] üéñÔ∏è The context under which this occured is materially-relevant to the rest of this discussion, so I will link it here:


[^yays]: _See_ the [above post](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1558#discussion-7245978) ("PREV") at n.3.
<!-- this works as long as we only ref PREVs in the footnotes -->

[![meridian-2024-ama](imgs/comments/builders-bridge-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/KTH85egVSzw?t=388)

Also, we wouldn't have heard live about your expert white-hatting if it weren't for [Jayrome](https://discordapp.com/users/769062410518134874), whom kindly reached out to community members to solicit AMA questions before the event. Jayrome relentlessly contributes their time, expertise, and consideration throughout open disucussions, prudent facilitation, and [news aggregation](https://communityfund.stellar.org/project/lumen-loop). And they did an unbelievably-tremendous job asking with relevant tone-setting context from 2022, genuine tact for differing perspectives, and an open mind towards possible solutions.

I believe so earnestly that these open communal disucssions are the secret instrument we can leverge to overtake entranched incumbent interests. Indeed, might the optimal solution for these network-wide quandaries come from the artful, attributable, and permissionless Discussions we've already seen lead to stellar outcomes in CAPs [51](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1435), [53](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1447), and [56](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1460
)?

## 1.1 Previous Mobile Working Advancements

Before diving into the nuances, I'd like to applaud you longstanding efforts to bridge different platforms to stellar with [a single SDK](https://github.com/rahimklaber/stellar_kt). üëè Too often, work might not see the light of mainnet despite the material efforts behind its development. But many of our long-term challenges can be overcome seamlessly thanks to those key thoughts, incremental imporvements, and persistant bug fixes.

As I've [tried to express](723_POL_COMMENT), I might not be intimately familiar with the particular nuances of JS/Native/JVM implementations and their core XDR (not Horiozn)&mdash;just yet at least. But it's clear to see that you're making [ongoing progress](https://github.com/rahimklaber/stellar_kt/issues) on what just might be the next big community project. And it's quite inspirational for me at least, to think that you're able to do all that on top of traditional work.

## 1.2 as introducing communal discussion and quotes

Unfortunately, much of this [thinking work](https://github.com/rahimklaber/soroban_token_dao) can get lost in the fast pace of release schedules. In the spirit of documenting [AMM design choices](HREF_PROTOOL_21_meeting?), I'll append some discussions from the [Stellar Global](https://stellarglobal.community) Discord. Namely, most of these messages stem from [shared concerns](https://discordapp.com/channels/761985725453303838/1292523643900919951/1301285580310839367) over a network participant's transparency, integrity, and liquidity governance influence.

> Right now, I can place an order on a thin orderbook and it might be filled if there's a path payment through it at that price.  Without the amm, I'd have to rely on just the volume in that pair, or maybe someone who happens to be running a bot against some soroban pool somewhere.
> There's also the fact that in ALL other chains, if I want to swap, I need to go to one site that runs a good UI for one pair into a common token (eth or op or sol or whatever), and then at least 1 other site to get to what I want.  Expensive, slow, and annoying.

# 2. Enabling Trusted Global Liquidity

Part of Stellar I find so incredible is the heavy lifting done by community validators behind the scenes. The diligent and selfless contributions bring accessable transactions to all. In this light, I [originally](https://github.com/JFWooten4/free-markets/commit/9b8c125b955594c1d73d1ace031146f9588a05fa) wanted to have our own nodes spun up to try testing for the simulated ongoing execution burdens.

Part of the reason for this logic is that I don't want to sit here asking for something for nothing. Namely, I'm only a motherboard, CPU, and NVMe drive away from getting things spun up.[^test] But that;s presently outside my scpoe of poeprational capabilities across organizations per survivability contraints _supra_ note 1.

[^test]: I particularly want to mimic some of the original SPEEDEX paper's results on a modern Threadripper. With some actual data, I can more meaningfully contribute to the conversation going forward. Albeit the precise configuration work is outside my meximal area of expertise.

That said, can we all agree that the contemplation given to my beliefs ought be weighed independently of my present socioeconomic standing? As I've tried to shortly capture, the beaty of the network really shines when it shares the best industry tech with all the classes of society. Could introducing "loyalty tiers" as is so common on central exchanges run counter to the ethos that genius can [can come from anyone](https://lnns.co/ZT-4HtxlXVK)?


## 2.1 Enduring Network Design Considerations

Expanding on the chief question asked in the video from Meridian,[^ngr] might we take a wholelistic consideration as to the cost of liquidity as it stands today? As volumnous comments in the singular conversation forum so far have releaved, liquidity is a key aspect of the network for users, developers, and advocates together. Reflecting on the asked investment of time, energy, and composability into interleaving liquidity, might we consider the sum network benefits?

[^ngr]: Which is different from the [round table](imgs/comments/garand-offline-roundtable.png) Garand mentions. I reached out to @SirTyson for comment on Nov 1 but haven't heard back yet. In the same chat linked in S 1.2.3, they say SPEEDEX "opens the door to a lot of interesting opportunities, such as higher trade volume, better compatibility between soroban and classic ops, etc."


Markedly, the choices we make around items like whether or not contracts call the DEX have significant downstream affects on whether the network runs well for users like us or the centralized institutions presently so dominant across other chains. I like to think there's a reason the large majority of demonstrably-compliant web3 investment products employ the network (or at least originally launched here). All this despite the current lack of attention on self-custody options avaliable to all.[^cbn]

[^cbn]: _See, e.g.,_ the UI depriortization of Stellar on the centralized exchange in note 7 of PREV, buried under every other supported USDC chain. _See also_ similar treatment in the Circle developer dashboard. These starkly contrast with the plethora of legal filings explicitly referencing the network behind the closed doors of legalese.


Might the self-custody implication inherent in existing exchange business models draw attention away from the SDEX? This might lead to a number of quandaries that came up in this discussion such as trading volume compared to propritary venues, AMMs, and HFTs. I believe wholeheartedy in our unique opportunity to collaboratively explore the most efficient globalized solution that satisfies the longstanding needs of traders, developers, and innovators.[^nex]

[^nex]: I might not know exactly what will cahnge about financial markets over the coming decades, which could materially impact SDEX requirements. But I have deeply studied the history of markets over the past six years in an effort to understand what _won't_ change, no matter how many centuries pass. Can you imagine a future where developers demand wider spreads, traders want fewer ways to game the system, or innovators want to build whole businesses on delicate foundations?

this should frame as a collaborative effort to explore other opetions not revelaed in my 1 v 2 hypothecation since theres so many incredibly-intelligent believers in network with genius ieas etrc decenbtralized (this implicates the points amde to Shaptic and adopted by in https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/pull/1043#discussion_r1811060899)

it is very very much worth it to "put a lot of effort into that" and doable

### some fincnaila-sector implications alongside the central regs in place now



## Expanding the Locust of Trust

there are very legitimnate centralization implications in upgradable smart contracts having hteir keys get hacked, as we see so commonly

i know there is soroswap (prob dont mention expckityl;)_ which does this without upgradability
but this segways directly inbto the very foundational argument that andy upggrade (and ther ewill be fucking upgrasdes _see unsiwap vers FN_) goes through the process of creating a new source of liqudiity
the only way to fix this is to have it at the protocol level so that upgrades continue preserving the existing lokced-up liquidity
&&
this will implicate making the argument against deposit locks as discussed on both sides of the agenda



### 
some of the args around being able to centrally control the liqudity, which is very very fucking bad

this was something that was brought up by XYZ FF/engineering in Discord convo (dir link here)


obvs we need to frame the whole thing around the args, let's start with some src quoite framing at the intro for 2.

even if we can momentarily agree that the "best" Sorobvan DEX(es) will attract a large amount of liqudiity, which dominates the network, this leaves the power over democratic trading in the hands of a select few organizations

presently, the instutitons which run these technologies are centralied, legal, for-profit corporations

this presents the very clear path for "traction" in terms of user funds locked to lead to VC interest

and VCS ARE FUCKING CENTRALIZED AND WILL DO WHAT THEY FUCKING DID TO 0X HOLY SHIT
this is a goddamn untennable posititon
like fduck you wall st

this shoud get framed in the very relevant context of S XYZ (thesis) in link NUM from S ABC in origingal work (which we should declare in the intro as "ABC/D")





the centralization of org argument shoudl implicate the only deleted/private video in [this blog post](https://www.redbellyblockchain.io/researchpapers/is-robinhood-wallet-truly-decentralized-unveiling-the-truth/ previosuly titled "Did the Robinhood Crypto Wallet Just Change Everything?" which very fucking clearly implicates the recent FCM modification (but don't change/mention that in any way whatsoever)

see also "Thought the Crypto Wallet provided on Robinhood was owned by me, but apparently not." at https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c8ifcd/warning_do_not_trade_or_store_crypto_on_robinhood/ (this should stay out of TAR)
