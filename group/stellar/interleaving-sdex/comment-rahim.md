Hi @rahimklaber,

Thank you for your thoughts, both here and shared on Discord. It was inspiring to hear via DMs how you got into the network, largely for humanitarian/real-world use cases. Over the years, I've found this to be a common thread linking us together.

In an effort to further these foundational principles that uniquely belowng to the network, might I quickly review my own understanding of these ethos? Chiefly, I understand that the founders wanted a decentralized payments network that was cheap, fast, and inclusive based on personal identity, not computing power. We seen uniquely adept to provide such a system given the legarthy, centralization, and gatekeeping present in other financial systems.

I'm writing this as someone who just wants the most efficient technology possible under our stewardship because I've felt so keenly the vast inadequacies of legacy markets for practically my whole life. They have ripped apart my family, taken nearly every drop of opportunity I've identified right out of my hands, and pulverized my aspirations as a mainstream asset manager.[^self] There is nothing I want more than for the network to succeed, and I believe wholeheatedly that we will triumph enormously over other technologies given the proper execution of scalable, decentralized, egalitarian markets. ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèø


[^self]: This is not a reply about myself, but I just want to share my openly-disclosed "stake at the table." I have aproximately $3,000 in both my checking account and Roth IRA; everything else is in [john.xlm](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GC5TUPFLOXCINDYHQVYYLLVYP6GKHT65ELB2Q2WLFTGN63YYIXPQTDFJ). I sold the vast majority of my assets three years ago for [$30,000](WHYDRS_TRADING_HREF_T), which I've been using to build the stock market on Stellar ever sense.

# 1. Extensive Recent Community Actions

Since this post, quite the collective discussion has popped up on the subject. Perhaps most relevantly, you were rightly given accolades for uncover in the deadly bug.[^yays] üéñÔ∏è The context under which this occured is materially-relevant to the rest of this discussion, so I will link it here:

[![meridian-2024-ama](yay from Jayrom img thumnail,with playh button)](https://youtu.be/KTH85egVSzw?t=388)

Also, we wouldn't have heard live about your expert white-hatting if it weren't for [Jayrome](spellcheck name throughpouit, use discord ID link to 769062410518134874`), whom kindly reached out to community members to solicit AMA questions before the event. Jayrome relentlessly contributes their time, expertise, and consideration throughout open disucussions, prudent facilitation, and [news aggregation](https://communityfund.stellar.org/project/lumen-loop). And they did an unbelievably-tremendous job asking with relevant tone-setting context from 2022, genuine tact for differing perspectives, and an open mind towards possible solutions.

I believe so earnestly that these open communal disucssions are the secret instrument we can leverge to overtake entranched incumbent interests. Indeed, might the optimal solution for these network-wide quandaries come from the artful, attributable, and permissionless Discussions we've already seen lead to stellar outcomes in CAPs [51](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1435), [53](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1447), and [56](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/discussions/1460

"you can't call classic order books from Soroban" so let's worry about that and fix it since contracts are trivial to implement as connecting data struct market participant (given already holding classic assets) but like researched
it is very very much worth it to "put a lot of effort into that" and doable

### requisite central plan or not, and omplications re introductory network value

### some fincnaila-sector implications alongside the central regs in place now



## Expanding the Locust of Trust

there are very legitimnate centralization implications in upgradable smart contracts having hteir keys get hacked, as we see so commonly

i know there is soroswap (prob dont mention expckityl;)_ which does this without upgradability
but this segways directly inbto the very foundational argument that andy upggrade (and ther ewill be fucking upgrasdes _see unsiwap vers FN_) goes through the process of creating a new source of liqudiity
the only way to fix this is to have it at the protocol level so that upgrades continue preserving the existing lokced-up liquidity
&&
this will implicate making the argument against deposit locks as discussed on both sides of the agenda



### 
some of the args around being able to centrally control the liqudity, which is very very fucking bad

this was something that was brought up by XYZ FF/engineering in Discord convo (dir link here)


obvs we need to frame the whole thing around the args, let's start with some src quoite framing at the intro for 2.
but actual info in 2.1 for ref


---
also we should ahve soemthing implicating the use of p[eople as the arbiters for trust in central regs , which precisely cucking translets to these contracts re wooten.link/uniswap

and obvs with this, you are very explicitly assuming liability to earn trust, whcih is exactly what fucking SCP is supposed to handle
i should have a fn harping on this and use it as pressure for SCP#25



---
long-term centraliztion implications

even if we can momentarily agree that the "best" Sorobvan DEX(es) will attract a large amount of liqudiity, which dominates the network, this leaves the power over democratic trading in the hands of a select few organizations

presently, the instutitons which run these technologies are centralied, legal, for-profit corporations

this presents the very clear path for "traction" in terms of user funds locked to lead to VC interest

and VCS ARE FUCKING CENTRALIZED AND WILL DO WHAT THEY FUCKING DID TO 0X HOLY SHIT
this is a goddamn untennable posititon
like fduck you wall st

this shoud get framed in the very relevant context of S XYZ (thesis) in link NUM from S ABC in origingal work (which we should declare in the intro as "ABC/D")





the centralization of org argument shoudl implicate the only deleted/private video in [this blog post](https://www.redbellyblockchain.io/researchpapers/is-robinhood-wallet-truly-decentralized-unveiling-the-truth/ previosuly titled "Did the Robinhood Crypto Wallet Just Change Everything?" which very fucking clearly implicates the recent FCM modification (but don't change/mention that in any way whatsoever)

see also "Thought the Crypto Wallet provided on Robinhood was owned by me, but apparently not." at https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1c8ifcd/warning_do_not_trade_or_store_crypto_on_robinhood/ (this should stay out of TAR)
