Hi Johan,

Based on limited investigation, [your implementation](https://github.com/future-tense/stellar-pathfinder-server) might just be the first custom pathfinding implementation. Pathfinding matters a lot in the traditional financial system‚Äîwhich perhaps you've seen firsthand with extractive conversion rates. Access to exchanges themselves is one main reason I‚Äôve found increasing costs through middlemen over the years.

That‚Äôs the easy explanation: nobody can directly transact with each other sans brokers. But pathfinding is the more sinister hidden evil corrupting Wall Street and others. Given its significance and common misunderstandings, I‚Äôd sincerely appreciate your help continuing [past efforts](https://wooten.link/liquidity). üíú

## Existing Limitations

I approach pathfinding from the perspective of traditional stock-market order routing. This is a [really big problem](https://youtu.be/bP74RBTE8kI?t=406).[^int] What we have with the DEX stands as the only option distributed as a truly free market.

The root of problems across markets comes from [capitalist competition](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022109019000814) for a public good and natural monopoly. The referenced study extensively finds that a single market for the stocks of the world would yield at least 20% lower effective spreads than a duopoly. Americans are all too familiar with two prominent competing firms, but much of the same can be said about private exchanges extracting rents abroad.

I really appreciated your help understanding the DEX [last year](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/907476473739354153/1273108124194050140). There‚Äôs no one I can think of across the ecosystem more adept at explaining the existing pathfinding than yourself. üíú I know we saw some misunderstandings about the existing pathfinding in discussions at the end of last year in Global and a liquidity-incentive server, so how about helping clear things up for everyone?

## Present Confusion

I regularly exchange with the government. Representatives and team leads sit at a crucial policy crossroads between centralized and decentralized exchange. We have a limited window to sway them towards the option that provides everyone with the freedom to access markets.

The core of existing routing happens through financial middlemen, as we know. These legacy for-profit firms can make money skimming off trades. Sometimes we see this as trading fees, and other times it's much more complicated.

One obvious conflict can be front-running, which we‚Äôve seen abundantly on other chains. Briefly, this has always been a problem on Wall Street. And it‚Äôs still extracting wealth thanks to the insane complexity of exchange infrastructure.

### Existing Regulations

The top American market maker is opening a new stock exchange just so they can make more money. This works because of nonstandard trade routing. By having more venues connected to their fiber-optic cables, the assholes can fuck you over nanoseconds faster.

The system is so bloated that the present regulations globally just can‚Äôt protect users from this exploitation. The governance is so difficult that the only choice is to leave everyone‚Äôs portfolios teetering on the trust of a select few enterprises‚Äîconglomerates with the same institutional interests who took everything from us when Nakamoto started up.

But here in Core, we have a solution which doesn‚Äôt serve the Rothschilds. A framework which favors efficiency, egalitarianism, and excellence at the highest technical standards. And, quite differently from even other ‚Äúdecentralized exchanges,‚Äù it‚Äôs a model poised to finally take away their choking reins.

### Profit Center

Trust, especially in the SCP context, is super nuanced. Without proper safeguards, we risk centralization at the social layer. Now, imagine that quandary scaled to infinity for an established routing system.

That‚Äôs what Apes saw in 2021 when one agency disabled stock trading. This Establishment handled order routing for hundreds of brokers with more users than existing network accounts. In later Congressional investigation, they received no disciplinary action.

The exchange of one asset to another is so simple. Yet it‚Äôs the first place many companies exploit to profit off their customers. We are all too conditioned into paying fees which fundamentally conflict with using path payments everywhere.

### UNbreaking Horizon

We can overcome our challenges paying for everyday items with real-world assets. üß† To make this happen, we‚Äôll need Stellar protocol routing. This pathfinding holds the key to unlocking liquidity in the DEX.






WHY: JH is na expert  on the  cpore pathfind algo,m  and  someone who deeply resposects hte Core efficincy.

A  lot  pof people look at the  DEX and see remmitance oppoortujnities,  perhaps not  fulyl comprehending  how absolutely  insane

Since you referenced me, and my custom pathfinder, is that something you think could be used as a start? From what I remember that's about a page of code, the central parts. I have no idea what Horizon ended up using after they rewrote it, but I'm assuming a depth-first search, just as I used.

Starting with X amount of asset A as a source asset, trying to get to B:

You enumerate all assets you can trade to in one step, be it DEX order books, or AMMs.
For each asset in step 1, you calculate how much of this asset the trade gets you.
If you've encountered this asset before, and your total was higher then, move on to the next asset, because you already got here in a cheaper way, and continuing on this path is a waste of time.
If there's not enough liquidity, you stop, and move on to the next asset.
If the asset is B, record the path it took you to get here
Unless you've exhausted all the hops, go to step 1 but with this current asset as your source asset.
When you've enumerated all you can, your best path from A to B is the last path recorded in step 3.
Dumbed down a bit: you start trying all possible paths you can go from A, but you stop each path if there's not enough liquidity, or if you've been to an asset before and you got there in a cheaper way.

Stargazer is path payments *only*, and practically unusable at the moment because of it, because path finding has exploded in execution time primarily due to NFTs. So I had to write my own pathfinder, and now it's doing OK.

If you look at it from a UX perspective, you're not doing one path find call per payment. If path finding is instant, you're maybe doing one per digit. If it's almost instant, you're maybe doing *ten* per digit. So you have to sit down and think things through really hard.

really thought through tthe depths like
Well I suppose that if auth_required means you can't hold or trade an asset without authorization, then logically you shouldn't be able to use it into path payment at all.







ss!!! We have Ticot reffering to XLM as unicversal base asset just like Garand at 
https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/4t_Z7dkRhSc/m/SdZqCNdaBAAJ )where Jhan jiumps in wiht the pathfinding algorithm implnentation way back in '18)
fuck man

[Garand's comments] that "Where soroban dex potentially fits into this picture is if you want to trade asset a in speedx 0 for asset b in speedx 1, you can't do that directly since they're in different speedx's. The way the speedx works, no asset can be in multiple speedx's, except for the lumen, which is in all speedx's. So you can trade asset a for lumens in ledger 0, then trade lumens for asset b in ledger 1. Or alternatively, trade directly via soroban dex, which would be more expensive and less effecient but provide more trading pairs" which is followed up with "to prevent liquidity fragmentation and arbitrage,"



we have path payments specifically referenced by core team as a means to creat IoC orders at https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/zks0oi4v-7g/m/sbw5vtstCwAJ

### Best Execution
The orderbook only matches offers at the price specified or better, when avaliable. For instance, say there are four buyers offering 10 bananas per apple. You can sell an apple for 7 bananas, and the offer automatically exchanges for the higher 10 bananas.

In traditinal markets, this is precisely how market orders allow instant trades. They simply execute agains the best avaliable prices in the common orderbook. And since we can see every offer, the DEX also gives us the handy ability to know if there's enough orders at the prevailing price.

When you submit an order, Stellar will also check wheter an AMM (below) offers a better rate than priced orders. If so, your trade executes against the pool at the better conversion rate without priced DEX liquidity. To better understad the market, let's uncover the spread between the best AstroDollar offers, calculting a midpoint trading price.


####  Path Hops
When sending path payments, your transfer can hop between up to six order books or AMMs to find the best price. Validators perform this arithmatic automatically, allowing you to specify only the lowest total amount you will accept. At each step in the path, the network calculates the optimal source of liquidity to convert through given your destination asset.

Both the order book and AMMs coexist, providing multiple avenues for liquidity. Instead of having to choose whether to go through the order book or an AMM, the pathfinding algorithm automatically checks both sources of liquidity and executes new trades using whichever offers the better rate. It also exchanges with an AMM over an order book at each step if the entire conversation happens at a price equal to or better than limit offers.


also we have the nbew section titling as `Conversion Liquifdity`

[^int]: Whl tis vieo focuses on the American market where I work, the problem is just as bad everywhere else on the planet. Adn for the countries not fortunate aenough to have a central stokc exchange , we see the horrific affets f malinvestment and unfune innovation. I think it'd be cool if the whole world was on the same playing field hwen it comes to euntrperenurial creativity, the core tenneanrt of a marketplace for capital.
