# Items for upcoming podcast via Emir

Can you tell us a little more about:

- The initial Signer's Guild members?
- The AMM contract development cycle?
- Ecosystem activity v. your approach to organizational transparency re stellar.toml?

Emir provided an article with these points:
- Holders voting on what to incentivize (this should be markets using underlying)
- DAO makes "decisions" over distribution of 1B arbitrary token treasury... (k??)
- "Singers guild" makes token ownership :"decentralized" (but not the protocol..)
- appreciate opening "empoyment" for 4-8 hours a week, but point is not a product

Unbased propositions shared:
- "Liquidity on Soroban will ultimately benefit Stellar the most."
- "Other projects, like Phoenix and Blend, are also incentivizing liquidity for Soroban protocols."
- "Developers can also create a pool on Aquarius AMMs and still benefit from the technology."
  - does not account for:
    -  listing fees
    -  central approval
    -  permissioned deployment
