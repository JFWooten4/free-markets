[Garand's comments] that "Where soroban dex potentially fits into this picture is if you want to trade asset a in speedx 0 for asset b in speedx 1, you can't do that directly since they're in different speedx's. The way the speedx works, no asset can be in multiple speedx's, except for the lumen, which is in all speedx's. So you can trade asset a for lumens in ledger 0, then trade lumens for asset b in ledger 1. Or alternatively, trade directly via soroban dex, which would be more expensive and less effecient but provide more trading pairs" which is followed up with "to prevent liquidity fragmentation and arbitrage,"
