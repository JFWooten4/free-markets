Horizonâ€™s pathfinding to determine the path before coore consensus

Doesnt document auto-routing of markt limit orders at all
undelying reliance on pathfinding intermediaties (SB)

If you look at it from a UX perspective, you're not doing one path find call per payment. If path finding is instant, you're maybe doing one per digit. If it's almost instant, you're maybe doing *ten* per digit. So you have to sit down and think things through really hard.
