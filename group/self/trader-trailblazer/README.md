# From Trader to Trailblazer: Web3 Stock Investments & SEC Review

I started investing because of [Ross Cameron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-cameron-70ba7998/). The professional day trader inspired me to learn more about the market after high school classes and a part-time job. He's the reason I ultimately quit my job to trade full-time, leading to writing my investing handbook. 🚀

_Nine to Noon_ and its strategies originate from trading "premarket gainers." That's a fancy phrase for stocks that went up a lot by 9am Eastern compared to 4pm the day before. Essentially, these big overnight moves garner volatility, attention, and patterns - all great for active trading. 🌟

## Something's Wrong

But one thing always irked me subconsciously. Why did I have to wait until 9:30 to trade the opening bell, when there were clearly some insiders or other investors trading the night before? 🌙 Was there some kind of special club? 🤷

Many years later, [Stefanie Kammerman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-kammerman-352a2181/) answered that question. In Dark Pool Secrets, she revealed how certain trade routing let big banks and brokers undermine price discovery by executing massive trades off stock exchanges. 📖

I couldn't believe market infrastructure could dictate how we invest - and whether or not we succeed. 🤯 That changed when I read _The Naked Truth_ by Mark Faulk. The report documented years of fraud in a company whose transfer agent allowed executives to issue and dump billions of shares on unsuspecting investors. Faulk reviewed many documents just a day before an FBI seizure. 🕵️

## Relevant Background

I'm just someone who loves trading - it's really all I want to do. 💹 That was until reading revealing publications from the likes of [Susanne Trimbath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanne-trimbath-1a6149253/), [Overstock](https://www.linkedin.com/company/overstock/), and [Erik Townsend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-townsend-26b2859/). These whistleblowers ([Eric Scott Hunsader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-scott-hunsader-91333135/)) showed me that, unfortunately, Wall Street revolved around making middlemen rich - not investors. 💰

We saw this firsthand at Wooten Wealth through hundreds of trades. But it all hit me when I paid about a third of my biggest trade ever to a broker. The profits from that trade alone let me pursue Block Transfer rather than a "real job." 💼

Just before Thanksgiving, we submitted [Block Transfer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blocktransfer/)'s TAD3 system for review by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.linkedin.com/company/secgov/). We're calling into question the need for 11 for-profit middlemen in every trade. _See_ our [Yellowpaper](https://blocktransfer.com/.well-known/yellowpaper.pdf) for the details. 📈

We want to give issuers, regulators, and incumbents fair time to understand #TAD3 and its implications. 🤝 In the [review letter](https://wooten.link/edgar), we let the Commission know we're halting all new client applications until they publish a statement about our new company, infrastructure, and compliance practices. ✋

## What's Next

Over the years, Block Transfer slowly took over my life. It lead me to:
- close down our hedge fund after its best year ever, 🏆
- call a stop to all personal investing after my best trade ever, 🛑 and
- speak with dozens of public American CFOs despite extreme introversion. 🗣️

Now, I'm just happy everything is documented on our website, company publications, or my patent application.

As I mentioned, we plan to grant the Commission as much time as they need to thoroughly review these materials. My personal best outcome would be for SRO classification - fingers crossed. 🤞

As for the immediate future, my girlfriend graduates next semester. 🎓 I need to generate revenue so that we can buy things.

Fortunately, my experience in growing my second blockchain venture has been incredibly educational. 🌱 This positions us to significantly enhance the value of other nascent tech companies, even without the application of TAD3. 💎 Our approach includes streamlined PPMs and conventional cap table management.

According to last year's small business [SEC annual report](https://www.sec.gov/files/2022-oasb-annual-report.pdf), most new startup investments come from Wyoming, California, New York, and Texas - in that order. We (just me right now) are going after Texas. Specifically, the report finds extensive capital inclusion in Austin - a tech hub. 💸

I always thought I'd start my next chapter in Dallas, largely because of its great public transit. 🚇 But, based on limited research, Austin seems to have more venture activity, startup success, and web3 acceptance. 🏙️

What do you think? 🤔 I'd appreciate any and all perspectives in the comments. Is Austin the place to go? 📍 Why or why not? Are innovative startups the best client group to help next? 💡 Why or why not? Relevantly, our platform will save public CFOs hundreds of hours per year. 🛠️ However, TAD3's effectiveness is constrained without several pending user interfaces. 🖥️
