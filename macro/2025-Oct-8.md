What a night. Yes, it is 2 a.m., and yes, I have been up for hour(s). I was so close to just working today, but I have been getting into dopamine ruts lately.

It’s when I get into an elevated state with stimulants, and then get hyper-fixated on irrelevant items. With Asperger’s, it’s just too easy to get locked in on those rabbit holes and never pop out. Unconsciousness generally solves that challenge, but that makes me feel limited by days.

I’ve been working so hard lately, and it would just feel really nice to have any form of appreciation from anyone. Don’t get me wrong, the sponsors are super helpful and motivating, but that’s largely consideration for past efforts with the assumption of continuing output. It definitely supports and makes things work logistically (partially lol), but I do still miss the days of constant PR support.

I’ve been getting back into the Stellar work that needs to be done, and unfortunately, as with a lot of cryptos, it’s basically only WIIFM (what’s in it for me; I feel like that’s not obvious). As with the Commission work, basically (with small exceptions here and there!) the only people to work with me are the ones who are paid by an external organization to do so.

It makes me think about the recent collaboration work with Truth. And how 6Days keeps on the grind no matter what happens socially. These are people I really want to dedicate my time to working together, and we’ve made great progress already on open channels.

I don’t understand why the world can’t just work like we do, supporting each other abundantly out of good friendship. I’ve tried so many times to reach out to the insiders of the bureaucracies, and it’s always too much effort to draw out creativity. To bring people just beyond what’s plainly necessary for productive collaboration.

I’ve got to think it comes down to the social contract around monetary consideration. There’s literally nobody I know who’s done retroactive consideration well and permissionlessly at scale before. And it’s a scary thing to do because of the threats from legacy financial intermediaries and regulations.

I’ve seen (and Chives, _inter alia_, has hashed) some of the most amazing free-market working arrangements ever. Just a public post offering some BTC to help with a project. Direct and accountable peer-to-peer transparency to help everyone move forward.

Yes, it’s harder than the boring salary contract. And if you take it to the end with tipping, then it requires more actual thought. But I’d argue it’s the only just means to effectively compensate innovators.

There’s still a lot of shit to deal with to make things politically acceptable. On one hand I see how this stemmed from past mishandlings, but on the other it is coercion to effect the centrally planned technocratic goals of institutions which seem convinced they have the power to determine what a retirement portfolio ought to look like. I don’t know for sure how we’ll walk away with interconnected co-ops in the future, but I do know the slow and strong approach will keep us miles ahead of alternatives.

## Goal

I don’t think I’m going to walk away from today with any super definitive answers. I really need to look over how my relationship is serving me. It’s just a big thing, and I feel like I’ll have a better grasp on all these answers once I finish the 723 work.

It’s taken so long to get the Stellar items across the finish line, and like wow. I feel like Rand spending two years on the Galt speech. I’m not sure if it’s the same length comparison, but I do know that the complexity is up there once I need to start testing the RPC endpoints for bugs.

Lol, I’m just saying, it would’ve been so much easier to trust the code off instinct and GPT if I could’ve kept it on Horizon. There’s so much more basis with it, so the training for both ends is near perfect. Watching all these systems unfold has brought me closer to the view of BTC’s role as a central simplicity implementation of a base currency, with the massive caveat that development on it needs to maintain permissionlessness without intermediaries.

I feel like I’m in a bubbled world of volunteering, GNU code, and nonprofit financial systems. It’s the world I think everyone should use because it creates demonstrably more efficient solutions for all of society. But I think I see what Marx was getting at in that it’s hard to implement if there’s still a segment of the population with primarily profit motive who choose not to participate in a revolutionary change.

The challenge is making it in everyone’s interest to participate, rather than attempting coercion. I feel like I could get a lot more of this across in space, with a little more resource abundance. A lot of people here seem completely brainwashed by the old rules.

### Methods

Sometimes I wonder if what I’m doing is even capitalism anymore. Early on it had such a clear base in the profit motive, and I’ve still got that check hanging on the wall. But it’s become more—in so many ways—about the value of my impact, which it evidently was towards the start. I recall Linus Torvalds writing a book along the lines of _Just for Fun_ describing their motivation, and at a certain point I don’t feel too far off that combined with Alastor’s sentiments.

I’ve certainly always thought a lot about legacy and how my work will help the future. I always documented, taught, and built as if someone like me as a kid was poring over what I did as source material. It was so inspiring to watch Ross, albeit for the central monetary capital accumulation reasonings. And I saw so much of the same when exploring Jed, purely on the intellectual side.

I had that little bit of money to start, and those profits just gave me the faith and leeway to go for the best thing. To take a shot at the ideal life in my mind. And now I just want to complete that vision.

### Charity

I think a lot about the artists I support who help me through the hard times. Their amazing content I get to consume permissionlessly, asynchronously, ad infinitum. I think I talked about how that really helped my development at the end of last year in another macro, going through all the new BGM music expanding my personal story themes.

A lot of people say you should budget X% of your income to charity, but like all I do is work in charity for no income. I see it more like an asset management challenge where you have a set amount of funds to create the impact you want to create an ideal future. I agree with any put support behind big orgs, but I just know the most impact will come from a concerted distributed group of independent actors passionate about waking up every day to achieve their ends.

I’ve unfortunately lost some of that passion lately, and it makes me think of Rand’s “spark by irreplaceable spark” sentiments. It’s just been so very challenging with wanting to be with Kayla despite her horrendous work schedule. The cortisol of all these weird hours is too much, and it’s completely wrecking my cognitive function. That’s the main reason I’m considering my options to move forward past all this.

She was never supposed to work, but I chose the nonprofit route instead of easy monetization. Makes me think of how Insull denied the banker’s offer for a leveraged share buyback trust five times before the sixth time when he finally caved in. Ofc that wound up completely bankrupting everything with control handed into the bankers of Wall Street, his literally sworn enemies for decades who just eventually got under his skin.

They took everything from one of the most amazing people, took everything because he relented on his vision in a moment of weakness. I think of the hundredth email I’ve got now from these disc venture twats. I almost dread opening my inbox for fear that I might take any of their grandiose offers even remotely seriously.

#### Reasoning

Why is that? How do I have such an entrenched commitment to the 501(c)(3) DAO? Was it even that to start with?

Obviously the goal has always been giving masses of people real savings and retirements. I think, at a certain point, that became antithetical to central ownership and management of the investment systems of all. If I presume we are this global infrastructure, then how can everyone maximally benefit when a central gatekeeper charges tolls for each use?

The information of human data can be dangerous. I think of how geotagged photos wound up killing John McAfee. But what’s more dangerous is everyone living like a blind sheep to the immense inequality permeating our society.

I think also of robots, and how they could help everyone live in abundant prosperity. It’s beyond my immediate scope, but I sometimes think about what it’ll be like managing assets after everything’s stable. I’ve certainly come to the conclusion that it’ll be near impossible to get back into trading per se.

That does hurt, and I’d be lying if I said otherwise. The dopamine and adrenaline from good technical setups has literally no comparison. And it holds the door to so much money.

#### Principle

But I know I can do so much more, and I have a responsibility to myself to exploit my ability to its maximum. Kayla helped show me that, and I would do just about anything to get back on a regular working schedule to spend just a couple hours with her at the _end of the day_ to prevent cascading distractions. I really do want things to work, because she represents every promise I’ve made—a collection of each bureaucratic pillar that’s important to me.

During the review, I resorted to jumping off high heights to physically hurt myself for adrenaline. It was the swings at first until I went so high I couldn’t walk for days. Then it was the ladder and ripe wall thing.

It was an intense time for an intense introduction to a meaningful partner. I put in so much because like I fkn care. I’m literally getting emotional writing this, and tears are welling.

I’ve noticed that it’s extremely hard nowadays to write about the DEX and free markets without getting to a similar state. I’ll go completely haywire and mega “fuck Wall Street emotional flow” mode with immense hatred and anger. I’m trying so hard to distance myself from that place I found myself in so often during the process, resorted to for the sake of maintaining consciousness in the lead-up to centralized deadlines.

At a certain point, the choice is between investing in what’s right vs. what’s profitable. I think my past self would die in cringe if he saw how little I allocated to centralized ventures with exceptional returns these last few years. But I just feel disgusting funneling my money into these compounding vehicles that perpetuate social inequality on the basis of privileged access to the Cantillonaires.

### Space

I hate having neighbors. And I despise not having my own space to work in flowing peace. I remember growing up how I would tiptoe downstairs every morning at 4 a.m. while writing Nine to Noon.

Mom would get so angry every time I made even the slightest noise, but I was hooked on carbs and needed to have breakfast before I started working. Now I see what she was getting at, because so often I can’t sleep because of the stimulation from others.

I can’t imagine how I used to live in the deep and noisy city. Like oh my gosh, I must have never had the quiet. I 100% see now how the muckrakers called the apartments scramp prisons where whole families were crowded into confined spaces.

I used to worry about the heating efficiency of homes (with four walls) vs. apartments with shared building sides. But oh man am I past that if it means I can go a whole day without talking to anyone I don’t want to encounter. Or hearing the noise pollution of dreaded industrialism.

Ahh, maybe I’m getting emotional because I’m lying here in the dead of night unable to close my eyes. I think of all these dreams I have for cities, transit, and space. It’ll probably be hard to get single-family homes on a whole station.

Makes me think of _Elysium_ (I think that’s the name), the movie about how most people live in poverty on Earth with a select few in space stations defended with deadly force. I don’t understand the inequality, and yet at the same time I can appreciate the market mechanisms which theoretically lead to its creation. But I don’t think anything gets this far gone without the central debt issuers pushing every industry to monopolies of infinite growth who can’t be satisfied enough with service to their stakeholders.

That’s really what I have grappled with identifying for a long time. What happens in alternate systems where you don’t expect corporate stock to compound forever, and we go back to the sustainable days of relying on dividends as shares fluctuate reasonably around par value? It’s a completely different period of capitalism that people don’t really study as much today.

I remember the TradersWay app on my phone, where I was simulating exactly that kind of market, without the dividends. In theory it could work like that, with excess profits shared with team members… But that implies no innovation and commoditized competition, which just doesn’t fit reality.

I long for the day everyone can be in comfort. I don’t see why it’s not possible with our amazing specializations. There has to be something going wrong at the top, where they hold the power to design these systems.

## Government

I think it’s crazy that you can spend your whole life going toward one trajectory to land in one position that determines your power and impact. I disagree with the concentration of power in elected representatives. If government is for the benefit of the people, then it should feel like a system designed at the behest of us.

But who can honestly say that today, especially if you live in the majority? All the giant billboard ads and centralized commercial interruptions for this or that candidate. While I appreciate that politics can and often is fact-light in deference to satisfaction, I can’t stand the vast disconnect between massive constituents left without a voice because they elect to not centralize their influence in body.

The individuals should themselves have a say because people are smart, but groups are dumb. But it’s exactly the opposite that happens today, where only large groups can afford successful policy penetration to the bureaucracy, and thus you need their support as well to successfully pay the media to brainwash the masses over to your side. For elections at least, this is a little over-assuming, as there is a legitimate art to becoming known when starting out.

### Aspirations

I think it’s really interesting in the sense of capital allocation. Whether that’s confiscated taxes or social capital, there’s a lot of depth and nuance you can get into. I remember an interview from a long-lost time ago where someone was like “Politics is the ultimate form of trading” on steroids, etc.

And it’s sort of true. I mean, where else can you make a choice (trade) worth trillions of bucks? Maybe doable in private industry, but certainly I would say harder. That’s presuming we think people should be able to make such a market-defining trade, which is probably a no.

A lot of the challenge stems from what to do for the subset of people that aren’t served by the market. And I think the best approach is to just make the whole system better for everyone. If we can bring the bar up on the dam of pent-up holdings, a rising water basin ought to create mass independence.

The measure of success for me is whether or not people actually wake up each day and do what they want to do. If the masses can escape wage slavery for service to the man who owns everything by birthright. BornLuckiest has such an awesome perspective on this alongside LimeGreen.

Like we are smart people, and there are tons of other smart people working on really cool governance challenges. So why is it that public offices teeter to the brim with bureaucrats pushing ulterior technocratic agendas? How is it so much wealth and influence concentrates in the hands of unelected thieves aiming to steal everything from everyone?

### Compulsion

One reason I think I took the SEC exam so serious is because (as remarked to Chives) they could literally shut everything down in the end. At least, that’s my interpretation of jurisdictional powers afforded, ignoring the reputational damage of fines which (while I was so worried about because it legitimately sets a narrative for all future work) I would prefer explore separately. Like how states can just nullify an incorporation and say no more to a corporate form.

I disagree with the modern use of states to form an entity. I much rather build in distributed online groups with weak social ties and independent conflict resolution. And it’s weird to say that as someone who’s always followed the letter of the lawbook so closely over all these years and entities.

But I think, even in the perfect online system, there is still some balance of power used to determine directional outcome. It will happen be it through forks or gavels. But I think specifically to the deadlines enforced by staff during our review.

I really do not know what would’ve happened if I didn’t make a deadline. I just went all out for them because I thought it was good form for an impression. But I have read some enforcement actions where it’s like “Respondent did not reply by the deadline,” and that was the basis for a fine or expulsion.

I mean I would find it pretty crazy, but doesn’t the letter of the law grant that power to these government workers? Like I think about how I was a week late in franchise taxes to Delaware, and they billed me twice as much as the annual rate. They get this power from the law which supposedly represents the will of the people, but I am just not so sure in certain cases.

It’s a tough conversation because the codifications seem really reasonable. They protect the public in this huge swath of real-world matters. But I think to the overregulation of nuclear power by objective scientific criteria that prevent construction and testing, which sets everyone back at the behest of oil and coal plants.

Like wth, fuck your entrenched industrialists, even if they have regulated monopolies. Zero reason they should be allowed to stagnate at the cost of our environment when something so much more efficient… ds fk. ds, f. ds, f. ds. It’s a similar challenge to WhyDRS: people just don’t know or have the bandwidth to change it.

The representatives are “supposed to change things” in office, but like that makes no sense because it implies authoritative power to compulse human action. That is not a good thing. It reminds me of the pharaohs forcing slaves to haul massive rocks into their pyramid schemes.

Why would we organize a society where an elite group needs the mandate of a powerful hand to have people act the right way? Why do the systems allow so much fraud and deceit even under the closest of regulatory eyes? And how is it that even with all this rulemaking dancing we still can’t rope in egregious offenders who poison the masses for profit?

It’s infuriating. I’m sorry, I know I’m trying to keep it cool. But my head just can’t with them sometimes.

### Choice

I don’t want to play their ridiculous game anymore, and I don’t think others should have to either. Practically the only solution I see rests in transparency, antithetical to excess central returns. If it’s clear to the public what’s happening in a firm, open to anyone to jump in to help because they care, and decentralized enough for them to actually have an impact—we probably just don’t need external regulators.

The hardest part I’ve found in achieving this vision comes down to compensation. It’s a lot to keep track of just about everyone’s progress. I think of the dirty unemployment schemes which pay the same person to the same name and address as if they were two people.

And heck, I’ve lived on the other end of that with my dad, lol. But the data standards aside, how do you bill without a central party? Who determines value and remits rewards?

I’ve found the answers in the community. I think one of the biggest reasons people can’t or don’t trust officials stems from desperation. But when someone constantly works within their public forum and that group determines value, I’ve only seen fair and generous outcomes.

The challenge comes in connecting disparate and independently thinking people. That bridging role shouldn’t be necessary to justify collective choices, given sufficiency of capital. It’s only when politicking for funding that an outsider has to judge efficacy of investment, which is the hardest part of communicating a project’s value.

Impact comes from this over a relatively long time. And it arrives in spaces once a technology or concept matures. But it’s definitely not the most immediately motivating thing.

## Mission

I’ve been adding back in the 7 billion dollars part on days when I felt particularly down. It just is a nice feeling and reminder that there can be an escape from all this where I get to live in my cabin on a mountain with plenty of grocery delivery. Gosh, what I would do to have the pool, gym, and sauna today.

In the same line as caring about my health, I’ve elected to permanently remove the deadline recital. Kayla and I were talking about college in the car the other day, and she was a big fan of having things structured and directive, etc. But man, I get anxiety typing this—my hands are shaking—just thinking about those damn deadlines, and it wasn’t even hard at all is the weird thing.

Anyway, I see why it’s normal to want a better life and particularly how it requires effort to incentivize the energies of others to build personal pleasures. I am giving masses of people real savings and retirements. I/we are carrying out my desire by creating an online broker that combined traditional equity, bond, and cryptocurrency markets in a decentralized system that rewards independent money managers, allows everyone to easily invest, opens active trading to the world, and helps replace existing banking systems.

Lately, I’ve been modifying that last part to be an “online blockchain” that “becomes the new financial system” (at the end). I had a much different view of brokers back when I was 16, as I couldn’t imagine a financial system without them, at least for stock trading. But I see now that they’re just like the banks I originally wanted to obviate back in the original ending.

And “online blockchain” as a shoe-on doesn’t really make the most sense given how anyone can index and provide that data through APIs. I guess my bigger concern is changing my objectives from a central viewpoint, specifically because these amendments imply greater power and influence across society and the network. I just find myself in such a fortunate position having discovered Stellar after making the goal and realizing it accomplishes everything I wanted and then some.

The deadline might’ve helped move things along in the centralized design scheme, but once I found the community, it just wasn’t necessary anymore. I’ve seen such an amazing group of people putting in all their spare time and resources, and I know we’re pushing ahead at full throttle. Even my own yearly breakdowns have become true not through central planning but collective effort, manifesting fortuitously.

### Dedication

I think of the means and ends I’ve faced since my last reflection. There was one particularly brutal night where I talked to someone over a serious work matter before driving over to Conshy for dinner with Dad. It’s around the time I realized just how much energy I drain talking to people.

I used to be so capable of doing it, when I talked about meaningless scholarly pursuits or joyful securities analysis. But things are real now, and I’m politicking at a level far and above what I experienced with Mom and Dad. Keeping track of the entirety of incoming details gives me an insane edge, and my mind will not let me turn off maximum filtering quality.

It uses adrenaline to keep me locked in as long as possible, to the point that I won’t be able to calm down or sleep for eight hours after intense discussions. I’ve got to think I’m processing everything during that time because I will become completely starved and eat over 4,000 calories in just the aftermath (has been all high-glycemic). My solution so far has been large healthy food intake prior to chats and then just one meaningful discussion each day, attempting to keep things within my limit.

That limit might expand over time, but there was a particularly nasty feeling after I had dinner with Dad. First of all, I was physically shaking the entire meal, out of immense energy deficit. Fidgeting, paranoia, hyper-fixation—you name it, I had just a complete inability to think.

That meant that it was very difficult for me to make decisions. This was really common, and it even came up just before we both drove to the restaurant. We were supposed to meet somewhere to eat, and I just couldn’t even look at my phone to decide on a restaurant.

This is abnormal because I always pick where we eat, as I am pretty good at it. I think this might’ve been the first time in years that Dad made the call when it was just us two. He’s always so busy and generally it takes a lot to coax him into finding somewhere at all.

So I told him I had driven to this park I wanted to skate, but barely got to enjoy much when it started raining. Lol, I remember some crazy college days where I’d use street wheels on wet pavement and hit some crazy slides. Oh my gosh, I was insane back then, literally running through puddles just to find my batteries completely shocked. (But man, was it fun.)

>
> There was one time I was with the whole group, and we rode over to Mercedes. I remember everyone in a huge group taking up the lanes together and turning some heads. It was so fun being part of the group with others who had the skills to execute exceptional rides.

Anyway, I don’t have those sorts of outlets or local community anymore. And so I was pretty much having a breakdown, incapable of thought, while I sat in the parking lot for half an hour. Dad was in the rental car nearby picking somewhere on his phone, until we eventually left to eat together.

It was nice for a moment to have someone to follow. There’s not really anyone who’s done what I pioneer in work, and so I’m always on the hot seat. During quite a few times in the review, it was nice to take a couple moments to just take in the world around me femininely.

I know it’s too far and asking a little much. But man, fuck, why can’t I ask for it? It helped so much during the process to give me a release from being at the helm.

> I keep thinking about having an assistant, and how awesome that would be. I thought I had that in Kayla, but she just works so much nowadays to keep us afloat. And it’s not a direct centralized controlling relationship, which is great except for when things get so frickin’ hard and I need certainty of reliance.

Anyway, per my poor ability to decide on literally negative fuel tank, I elect to order some vegetables for dinner. It’s a complete nothing meal with no fats or substance, reminiscent of the time I ordered a cauliflower steak after a hard day of skiing. Back then I expected a big slab of meat, and everyone thought it was funny when dietary expectations were similarly disappointed by the result, although in this case it was just quantity of food.

Dad was nice and shared some of his red meat. And I just couldn’t find the heart or mental bandwidth to decide on ordering another item. So we left after he kindly offered me a declined invitation back to therapy.

I waved goodbye to him after we walked around the pretty rustic town area for a little while. Then I went to the park (little garden with a couple benches) next to where I parked. I was just sitting around flossing for a while because I was still super stressed, and Dad was nice enough to notice that and come chat with me for a while. After an hour, I’d fleshed out some of the stressor points and brought up the proposal, to which he was entirely supportive but echoed sentiments from dinner that I can’t kill myself at the expense of my goals to help.

It was a nice and reasonable response, and I honestly expected more pushback on the proposal given the years of hesitancy over dating Kayla. But he just doesn’t understand how deeply I need to accomplish this vision to bring forth everything I know is fair and just in the world. How insanely deeply his profession and industry has eviscerated our ability to prosper at the behest of central bankers.

Then he gave me some money for gas and some painkillers, which I employed to write Response 6. He didn’t have to do that, and it was nice to just chat for the first time in a long time. I think it was about 10 o’clock by that point, and I should mention that I had six five-gallon jugs filled up in the back of the car from an earlier pit stop in Richmond for Twice The Ice.

### Crash

I feel like my whole “job” on these days is to write. I remember early on, Kayla made fun of me for taking this time. I explained to her how important it was for my processing, and she was just like “You don’t get paid to reflect.”

That sorta hurt, and she’s definitely had a tough time giving me space when I need it. At first this was awesome because the love, affect, and attention were incredibly stimulating. And they still are, but I need some space sometimes and she just does not respect that.

Huh, well I suppose that’s one reason I went to have dinner with Dad on that night in the thick of it. I could check the calendar, but memory serves that it was a couple days after a major submission for the SEC, when I was taking my time to gather thoughts and materials for the next round. For clarity, I never had anything we sent through prepared beforehand except for the exhibits, obviously.

Even the photographs in Response 8 were all taken within the last month or two, with the exception of the New York image from the Sabrina trip back in like March, I think. My calendar is digital, so it’s ruled out of being referenced during this drafting. Except for that old one, which I am so happy to finally have scanned and ready for input, because it’s such a pain to keep two sets of digital and physical records, so I just don’t want to deal with that anymore.

Anyway, all that to say that this is really hard for me to write. Like a lot of this, I’ve spent hours just thinking on this point. It’s scary and centralized and who knows what else. Part of me thinks it was just the exhaustion from a late night out (albeit after sleeping in). But I can remember my mental state at the time relatively vividly, and that is just not the whole story.

I was about 25 minutes into the drive home, and Google Maps took me down the farmer roads rather than the highway, since the restaurant was south of the entrance. I actually was circling around a little in the neighborhoods when I started the route just because of how I was parallel parked. But anyway, once I got on the main road I followed what it said.

I don’t normally drive with music. I don’t like distractions, or at least I’d rather have an audiobook going if I’m going to get to the point of needing to listen to something. I enjoy the sounds of nature.

That road was especially nice because it was completely empty, a godsend later on. So I had the windows clearly showing a pretty scenery with minimal streetlights. That’s when it happened.

I was thinking about everything that had just gone down. I didn’t expect to tell Dad about Kayla that night, but it just naturally conversed that way in the park when he came over to help. I really was trying to just work through things myself and get ready for the ride home. It was such a quiet night after that.

My head was spinning with those family thoughts combined ad infinitum with work. Everything that was happening, complicated to a million degrees by the fact that the Commission is a feminine bureaucratic organization which I treat equivalently to a pretty woman. The nuance and complexities of future actions were just firing endlessly during this review to get the best outcome.

That was when I really felt alone in the depths of it all, and I had turned significantly toward Autumn for emotional support. I couldn’t bear or reconcile the thought of following this one life I’d set down when I had this incessant need to understand what I was craving from them. For clarity, I’ve come to recognize this now and am in a much better place with all that.

The mental energy drain thinking about all this was just too much. I sat up straight and fiddled around with anything I could to keep myself alert on the road. But at some point I passed out and found myself barreling into a cornfield.

When I woke up, all I could see at first was an army of stalks coming at me at 40 miles an hour. My adrenaline kicked in and I saw the road off to the right. I didn’t have time to think about the power lines adjacent to the road; I just veered to the right and stepped on the gas.

I worried that any slowdown could trap me in the field. The stalks were higher than my SUV and already getting stuck in the windshield wipers. When I busted out of the field and saw the incline back up to the road, I went even faster to make it over the ditch I must’ve flown over.

Thankfully I escaped collision with any power poles. But I landed on the other side of the road going into oncoming traffic, and that’s when fight or flight really kicked in. Fortunately, there were no immediate cars and I was going fast enough to confidently merge back right immediately.

During all this, I could hear the gallons of water flipping over in the trunk and spilling everywhere in the car. When I pulled over at the first crossroads, a waterfall practically spewed out when I opened the doors and trunk. I was just glad to finally be pulled off the road onto a level patch of grass.

### Magic

I know my writing has power. I can use it to sharpen my narratives and craft the ultimate weapon against Wall Street. I’d finally found the community to share that magic in the DRS group (this was after Response 4), and it just felt incredible.

I’d been coming to terms with this over the review, and Flawless Sparklemoon really helped me internalize the change. I had only discovered Tamers while looking into the darkest of nights for something, anything, to take the edge off after an insane submission deadline. And his art gave me so much to be thankful for, so many laughs, and so incredible new community friends.

I’ve really been internalizing the music about her, because that’s the only thing I can keep looping while grinding on work. Not that all the episodes with and without her aren’t equally amazing. But I just need that heavy rock adrenaline and loud noise in the hardest of times.

Thanks to everyone for that. I hope I can share how much it means with money. It’s nice because I can allocate feelings as capital without challenging vocal expression.

During the review, I changed my X profile picture to BGM’s rendition of Flawless because that’s how I felt when I had every answer to every staff question. Exhibits to back them up and all, just made me feel really good, like I’d done everything right. But as it kept going on, I realized just how much work it is to keep that persona up forever.

I’ve always known the pressures of being a directive centralized CEO were just immense, and I honestly felt that during the tail end of using the profile photo. I don’t want to be flawless, living as the sole central arbiter and actor capable of moving things forward. I don’t want to be the bottleneck who makes every perfect “right” decision on behalf of others, even if I do find myself a unicorn.

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love applying my skills to create impeccable work product. But Flawless is on another level. She crafts a uniquely centralized vision for how everyone in the world should live, and she uses force to bend all into her will.

She’s too much on the intro, and when I was thinking about this deeply we hadn’t gotten that episode where she’s Scootaloo’s gf in school. Err, well I know that’s not exactly right but like just to establish the timeline; she hadn’t been humanized as someone who also has struggles in life.

I feel like that’s how a CEO needs to act, at least when facing the public. They have to be perfect in every way because the words that they say could hinge billions of dollars in stock value. It’s an unreal responsibility which only exists because of their absolute power over operations.

Absolute power is a bad thing, and I only see it really get to someone’s head in monopoly capitalism. I want to build something that I believe is a natural monopoly. Thus, I cannot let myself get trapped into that role.

That’s why I felt really challenged despite my frivolous “lower” title of CCO, which didn’t even make it to the end of the exam review. It’s just meaningless nothing that masked the reality that I was doing everything. And that is just not sustainable or the best protection of investors.

It’s just not. You can’t have good governance or risk controls with one fucking person able to call the shots or else you’re fired. And no amount of internal controls will take that reality away from the hierarchical power structures embedded in legacy corporations.

For instance, there was a document written at the behest of Corey (asynchronously) which outlines everything I wanted from a wife. While it’s lost to time, I still think back on it and have remnants. Actually there are a lot of things recreated like that on the back of my immense-whir annual calendar.

When times get hard, centralization is such an easy answer. It gives you everything you want in a simple little package. But I want to be flawless in a different way, reliant on the complementing strengths of others.

I _know_ I’ve got the basis for Trixie’s half from trading, marketing, and speaking. Each of my water jugs has a cap with a cutie mark and, after the crash, I lost the Twilight one when it fell out of the trunk. I choose to stand up and be the Sparkle markets need so that we can be perfect together as friends.
