Hi and welcome to my blog. 👋🏼

The posts in this repository are published automatically with **GitHub Pages**. Just browse to the Pages URL (usually `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`) to read them online.

All the Markdown files under `docs/` become pages on the site. Edit them directly and push to Git to update the website.

Please let me know your thoughts in the Discussions tab!
