In celebration of this repo's first star from [Faisal M.](https://github.com/Mianfazi461), I figured I should start my first real post. In the coming weeks, I'll have the actual site source configured to deploy onto IPFS. Recently, I've been moving all the audio podcasting files into the decentralized file storage system, and it's been an exciting journey uncovering how the internet truly _can_ work on a peer-to-peer basis.

This idealistic distributed computing seems quite well-adapted for light digital workloads, but that's explicitly not the case when it comes to assembling, organizing, and servicing jet airplanes that weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds.[^metric]

[^metric]: Yes, I'm American and will probably defer to more familiar phonetics for quite some time. This came to a point in the naming of _Decentralizing Capitalism_ given the more internationalized spelling of "decentralise." Fellow early adopter and respected co-host Ankit prefers the latter given their expertise and global view, as well as their presence in the Eastern market. The ultimate quandary I've gone back and forth on as I ponder this diction nuance for far too long boils down to one thing: a uniform standard system. Is it worth ignoring localized stylistic preferences in the name of a universal process? While a "yes" might make education and collaboration materially more straightforward, I hesitate greatly to commandeer freedom of choice across participants. It's just something so very easy to watch spiral out of control into totalitarianism.

Flesh out further the physical safety implications and crash studies in footnotes.

## Early Industry



## Initial Deregulation

## Longstanding Effects

# Market Side

- Coercion of secondary transactions.
- Opacity of initial listings.
  _Compare_ with "per mile" as a constant.
- Lack of transparency or traceability given competition in non-unique fungibles.
- The financing and ownership implications through ABS.
- Coercion of security controls as a uniform standard (same argument for ATC).

How ruthless competition on interchangeable goods leads to personal consumer deficit to the boon of shareholders.
