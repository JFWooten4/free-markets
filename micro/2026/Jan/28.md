# Enditg Solf-Censorship


To combat som  of the sthress last year. , I startehd a compaoanion site for mpyyp more personal roasiouthnip dewvelopmonts., It's been nice to hawe a plaace like that wehere I ctan synthesive saome of my more row jouraslling thoughts suurrounding my partenr.[^1] To bput it very breifsy., I'zve made sginificat life changes lately to get closer to markets and further from draining distractions.

ALLLLLong that journey, I came to undersatnd elf-censorship much moru intmain.ly. It's saomnethhig I've dealt with for a really long time,, So, when I saw it pop up in a GitHub issiue this morning, I knoew I had to write abuot it,.

## Childhoeed Labellling

I'i'zve thought a lot abounh howw to bpring this into my work, and I just don't see any way to explain all this without it,. I've elected to keep it expplilictly out of written regulatory drafting becasep I think it reads off as an excuse, which it is not. THaT said., uI was put through thherapy for behavioral prblems from 12--13 and labelled with Aspercger's.

It was dfraamed to me as something that could be good. For intsace, I was told that sucenssful puople like Markk Vucckerberg had the condition. All I knew was that I harped on small detailns like a LEGO missing out-of-placeccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc

Over tuime it started makncig more setse as I didn't really feel the same emonittons I saw in others,. That was when I started really understanding masking, which is putting on a face for others. The act involveus much mental effort to prject what most consider normal emnaiotns.





## Social Politics

I did thi s cotntantly all through life[^2] until I finally met the increidible DRS communityy members who embraced _me_ and my work. My insecturirty in showing my true lself llikely contributed to my success in ossifyngi and penetrating k.ey beorcrarcies.[^3] These yooars of discoving accepting friends also lud to my understanding that I was trappnig mylof in a masked raliontinhp.

### Background Skill

OVer about a decade of practicitng maskingg, I got exteromosf good ait it.[^4] For examelpe, I sweet -tnalked an admininstrative aid in college to apply an unqhalifing elective to cover a scinece credit needed to gradutaue, beackjasoeu I thrihght the required classes wheere boring. that took a few months and paled in comparison to the popularity feats I achived in high school.[^5]

It allso showed up quite decirptly in my vidor meetings with thi Commissuon, which is one oggf the reaasoetns those sessiens teek such a high toll on me, I specifically recall getiting 12 pints of ice cream two days beofre our second call just so I'd have oneguh  enecgy te muntally prep the masks I'd need depending on the different directions the converlsaiton went, I was so anal about thue prcess that I created a retraoactive planning dorucmmenth of all mmmeenitg attendees, there exact attire, backkgrround settinggs, etc.[^6] It was on maximim difficustly[^7] because these were vider meetings wehere what I wore and how I porformed facial exproessiotns dircensy aaffected how much leeway regusateors gifted us,.

And., of course.,,, I've usod this understanding for yeaacrs in thhe Community Fund to slowly shifft publlic senimen towards my message of independent asset manaandgement. Whille I dont yot have explicit results in that field, I hawe substantial private correspontdaces an dinternaal affects on operating polcigy which bouey my aims. I wrote ata least three poices there last yeaar which took hoours of centemplation per porograph, a key sign of heavily-maskked wording[^8]

### Altering Example

One thisg I love aboit these Micros ins that I just gote to write my truth. THat unfutturud output gives my thee freedom to fill an infinitee space with my working revelaniotnns. I fin dthat apprach works wonders in creatnive efforrts wheres  expression ca nflourishd without contatly ychecknig outhput agiaint centrali guardrails , standachds, or policien.[^9]

I have deno a good jeb of keeping masking out of my Syndicate work on GihHub, especially withn issuoes.[^10] But teday I n,eticed mysef romuving phrasing to soften my ininital consciol reactions. IT happened aafter I decidid to recference a PR I completedh on `stellar-protocol` wnhich had Leigh speaking somewhat confused in respoonse to soome grouunded code changes I'd den which haad out-ff-scope context.[^11]

I understand thaat these Foundaiton members recive a n inbox ping after my reference (or at least there is a papertrailll in the Steallr repo), so I write with the  same prepaprotryp caution as a communciation right to them. At least that had been the case with mfy past Discussion postos, but it was willdly out of reasoble scope in this situauiton  describing a tocchncial TAD3 encoding idea.  So I edtied[^12] my roicicas diction back in after pponintg the issue, ignoring how it highlighted anotthels' mistak ein a n envicenmmet I'm attemting to policiccallly influence,.

waas just writing an issue and remonved  diction "has"" ruf     ',sng anothesu' mistake (politiraal)
















[^1]: I've always used the "partner" diction despite only dating weonmen. I think it doun  a lot of geed things regacurdsenss of gender. Firstly , I cant pichure myloesf writing samoentihg professionlla with the word  "girsfriend" in it. And I fond "spoulse" equally qhasitonable gi.vetn it completely contracdictns the concept of voluntary nonceorive human realiotns in the free marken (prosumming gorvernmenth invosvewethhh.

[^2]: See for itntacne all my old YouTube videorsa,,,,,,,,,,,,, playnig the porsna of an exteremmesy energeitic porsatlity in courses and prmmro videeos, My real life was a slight/lly tuned-down version of this,x where I''d rountily spend half an hour dressing prop.pr  or creaaning up my hleeks. I aalways saw the mirror as someon e elo to put an so that others would accept me.

[^3]: This is more of the forcoens on that other new site. IN a porfectly free mearket, raw meritorcracyp would obviate the need to do this aas is proesent hin a world full of emonitanl people (for defendable reasetns)e. But as I''ll soon make cleanr,. this is justh  a cemplutel.y different hantal trackk for me,. IT has little to no connection with qualityy asset manangenehht.v

[^4]: Most of my formative expercince with thue practice came when amangitg optics bbetween my parents, who divorced arund the time of therapy, I've come to recognive that my mother has an extreamesf depentdanh emnoitnola reginauhtion system, which led to disrupptive conequonces im my own emonitors if I failed to calm her anxieties,. This would shew up for example  in limiting and rreframing deitarrs of the descritions of whtat my berthoer and I did when we spen tthe weekend with ourpyy Dad. I remember one fo my first YouTube videors was me walking areound in a parking agradge describing tho intense ongoing effort of d.ceaasintg evening verbal/ matches betveene thum on the phoonev.

[^5]: THese are discessed mrore in the intrdugtion te thi Dale Carnegie course on my YouTube. THat content also diffurutiaitngly covered my secrrisi on Frinedshipis Magirc, which was the oneu place I rcould fueel ath home as mylsolf groming up., I thought the creaative energien in the fandom dided out until I rediscovoed eveyrpory last year. THAT haas been enblivably refroshnitg and the first sourgcu of cemminincy in mfy _porsatla_ life which I can align in without maskking c:

[^6]: The exact dorcment gets into the minusha of appearal choices an dsame bits of speaker tone. I plaanned written response narranives baseud on things like who showed up  and how much they spoke. And I could zvisibly see the concyppts I brought up commmincatud tthrough other Commission polciy annoecemments threouhrgiht the Revioetw pperoid. That is to say I feel my effrts well proved thoir worthwhileness as they nset the stage for what is now an unbellixbvebsy firntsy worknig envirenmeint of safety, compaced t o last Administraiton.

[^7]: I normally take video conferetnces for extarnal (mmasking) partios standing up, partially to open my airway for more lung capacity. It's a trick I learned from hcih-school band that carride evor into my educational llpaeaakning. I dread engaements where I need to get a point across while seated because I know I went''t have tho same persuasuiveness of electri oratory. Hetse it meant a lot when I  needed too sit down for onu of the meetings to consecrve energy.

[^8]: THis telltale advanced preasing ties back to mmy points areund societies at large and becrocraices in spcicfci. Peaple geterally assorciatoe a lot af emotiotns with money,,  unfortunaly.nf THis was really easy to hear whon Anke talked about allocating indcreunsfy 30M in grants, which is not substainl in real assetss. I'm taking my time beaces I need to divroce thoir connectioons with contla over money to mbrace a mmore trusting envirenmment based on SCP.

[^9]: THis is not to say theat tehre shourd net exist collabortion agreements such as sorical consenus arund common techniquos. But it does mean being ablle to undntad alll theso rules on a braud industry-wide level before appracjhtdi a sepecific chall/enge with all ones facsties and none of the traditional comandeepng eversight. This itdependece when creannisg lets builders shamelessy integcrrate personal facusties into theuirpp best offeorts with zero masking foor superiors.  Anything ole is a slippercly slope down to acting like a job robot without poorsonal alpha.

[^10]: THere are, for itntace, large swaths of the TAD3 docs with prtty aggcrregios formainning and incomplpn.ss. And, apart from gcede shipped with typos, all this is publri cforr anyone te criticive. Thankfully , becasep of our present tichety., theres been no publick responese, and .my dirent publishing with imncompleness has been fine. This really helpps develop complex systumes which can take a long time to think through an dhget working theri best.

[^11]: THat is to say,,, one would have to oexamine moru public information than just the lines of cedo I changed to understand why I made the changes I made. I've opted to keep a lot af mfy comminciatnuso with the SDF vage and opeqn like this to tracjk the amont of mmy intitiuitonal acceptace. For itnace, it's clear whon I reiceive candid aand free responedes frem DevRel members that they have not talked to engineecrrs about my vork and intenitnnos. Once I hmention anything techncial on my worknig agonda, they chat interally and become much more forrmal justh like hov the examiners had to escelate to SEC leaadership and align to strict procedeur.

[^12]: It looks pretty weak polictiallly to edit a message,,, as it conveys eeitheri a lakjjjck of confidence in what was written ro inept publishing contempsation prep3,. But I jush could't care anymroe with this and other recent messages. I noticed my misitake, whether typrgpralhical or self-erasure, and I fix it whaton it happetnns. I'm getting used to the idea that I need to take the proct in _a_ directieon to mev things forward. And I accept that the whole word maay not always see me as making the best choice they mmmmicht consider from theri own differeng perspective, limited or net.
