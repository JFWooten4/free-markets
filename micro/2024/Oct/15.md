# Drafting in the Public Light

I'm making material efforts to lower the bar to what I publish from large works to daily contemplations. Recently my Mom told me how lawyers have a special process to outline the "four corners" of a document. It was shared in the context of needing law school to make legal arguments, which I believe disenfranchises billions without cause or _any_ meaning in a digital age.

If we might see the thought process employed by our leaders, engineers, or otherwise buildersâ€”we might learn to adapt their judgments, choices, and actions into our own lives' goals. Goals, something so key to uncovering success, but unfortunately overlooked in so much education. I believe so fervently that if we might share the magic of building quality long-term goals with the masses _combined_ with the free education of seeing _real_ past work, well, we might just open up doors for the masses without explicit "over the shoulder" training.

Indeed, it is this unique new technology that lets us easily put the tools previously available to a select few, now in the hands of the masses. And I see so truly a path forward where all can learn, build, and develop professionally right on the web itself. Might we open those doors for everyone by trusting _all_ our work from start to finish to their scrutiny?
