# Equity v. Debt Innovation

I've been thinking a lot about the Global South lately. For years, I;ve had the sens inside tha thtere's something seirously wrong with the present monetary system. Namely, i remember driving 40mins to the nearest bank which would offer a free checking account for MonerAds in high schoool. 

I just think there's something so fundamental;ly wrong with chargin people to use their own fucking moeny. Like it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It's just absoluitely heresay at best.

I don't know how I can express to you how imporant this is to me. It's very challenging for me to caputre my emptions in black and white without `href`s. But I just don;t have time lately for this context in a `micro`.

## Challenges

Debt is not sustainable. It introduces negative compounding growth. Negative compounding growth leads to inflation (since you need to increase the total supply of money avaliable to everyone in an effort to make it possible for borrows to repay their loans).

I guess one way to think about it is if we're on the gold standard but say for argument's sake we mine all gold in the unisverse. If you lend someone gold at [Insert Any Number Here] percent interest, where are their going to get that "new money" from/ They can't get it without taking more money from their neightbor than they borrow.

But where does the neighbor get the money to pay the borrower? It comes from the global supply of money. And so on some other end of the world, someone els eneeds  to borrow money.

THey need to borrow money because they have to buy things to survive. But if we have N+1 "money units" in the world, then the supply of what you can pay from introduces problems once you get to N d"money unites" of demand.

In a globla econmomy, this presents material challenges if we all use the same money unit. While I fucking love forex trading, it seems like a common money would best serve an increasingly interdependent global consurtioum. Namely,  this makes it much easier to price consumer products, wage rates, and investment assets.

This is a good thing because now you don;t have to woerry about which "money" to save in/use/share. Instead, you can live worry-free of how your money might change in value to all other moneies. Indeed, organizations may have entire arms of employees tied up in the needless arbitrage between different money options.

This is a good thing because poor people can't justofy the time it takes to analyze, arbitrage, and invest in differnt markets for moeny in any specialized way. It would basically need to be an entire side-gig, and for most poeple that would be a complete waste of time to save small amounts of "money"/wealth, assuming one fiat doesn't become massively more valuable. But in this edge case, then you would just only save/use/give that currency, which is the same arguemnt for having one money unit.

## Interest

So, we have compounding negative money. This, as we said, is because it takes more money to pay back money borrowed. But where does this "new" money wind up. ðŸ’­

If you guessed banks, you;d be right. ANd the challenge with banks is they are (increasingly) centralized "houses" for capital. If we can presume that money is power, then this means the centralization of the world's power in the long run. And of course, absolute opwer corrupts absolutely.

So how to we stop the next financial crisis, a plutocracy, and unwarreanted empoweverishment? Of caouse e eryhting ties back to the bitocin arguemnt that we "need to fix the money." But Bitcoin is fucking challengesd materially.

I think this is because Sassaman dies so early on, so there was no empowering leader into the war. Headrd an interview with his widfe today (only a few mins) where she said "she didn't know if it could be him" or something sicne he was good at keeping secrets. Will be interesting to see what the host finds if they go through with analyzing the old laptop drives.

Anyway the concdurm here is that you can't localize money if we assume that we might use Bitcoin as the new money unit. What i mean is that, since it;s about the same speed as fedwire, it's damn near impossible for you and I to ever use it . If this is the case, then we cann;t self-cusotdy our assets.

This is an extremely bad thing becuase now we still need to rely on these centralized instutions to hold our assets. And what have these centralized instutiotns done over any over again for centuries? They fuckin loan those assets out at interest.

~~If the instutions~~ When the insitutions loan out bitcoin, they set up the borrowsers with a Pascalâ€™s Wager. Bascially we're assuming hat the number of people who borrow BTC stays low. This is so you can alwyas have moere BTC not lent avalable to pay.

But remember that debts compound, and so even a small number of borrowers of a trivial amount of BTC will eventually lead to more BTC owed than 21m. And of course now the problem is that we basically need to crash the conomy by defaulting on the world's debt, or something along those lines. This could get violent.

## Euity

Equity is probably how people invested before fiat money and the relative exaustion of the world;s gold supply. Loans of gold are find i there's an entire nother contintnet with massive unknown reserves. But it just doesn't work if we only increase the supply by 2% a year.

It (gold loans) would basically force banks to only charge up to the inflation rate of tha amount of gold in existance. If ofc their not oging to fucking do this because of the clocalized self-interest of shareholders. And so whoever can play the lending gmae best will utlimately become the only bank.

This is aparallelerd in the centralized of Ameircna banks, difficults of establishing a new US bank, and ofc the monoplization of Fed region banks. So, in the long-term, that leaves us with one bank.

However, the process by which that bank came to central power has created more money unit entittlemnts than exist (in BTC case) or can be repaid sustainbly/without uncovering new magic asteroid resources (in gold's case). 

I don't htink it's responsible to base a moneyart supply of mining aseroids. _See Donâ€™t Look Up_. Accrodingly, it's rresponsible to lend something with a fixed or rate-limited supply growth.

Indeed, the only way to support such a system is to inflate the money unit into oblivion, as we see in fiat. Or let everyhting ocnitnually crumble down in repeated "business cycles" which are just fucking bank notes comming due and credit tightending. Over and over again this perpetuates.

But equity investments work! They finally give us the answer to capital allocation. And indeed, this is preciesely why the best equity in estments (in terms of deal for the issuer0 come from decentralized raising efforts.

## Proposition

When a startup (or even a small private company) needs capital, they presently must turn to a centraliczed fund, assuming they need any material amounts not avaliable from a select few local people or communities or grants. There are not as many capital-distirubution organizations as there are investors. Therefore, it becomes impossible for the issuer to raise at the valuation which would be paid by the most bullish members of a socierty.

If you think we should prop up the returns of the 1% who have access to these VC funds, then this is a good thing. It gatekeeps stellar investment opportunities to as select few _beurocracies_ given the power ynamics implicit in the LP/GP strucute. This ais a very basd thing for who "controls" which startups succeed, which fail, and which have their ideas stolen by early ivnestors (that were pitched but not binded to an NDA or investment deal).

The NDA implications are extrememly interesting and a little outside the scope of my main reflection today. Anway, the point is that we need everyone to have access ot the equity side in an effort to make the syustme actally work for everyone. Otherwise, we're just centralizinig the risks again and again int hte hands of a select few _middlemn_.

These people are seperating you from your moeny. THey are an unneccesary transaction cost imposed on every human being. And they only serve the money masters.
