# Hey what's this

I decided to start doing "micro-reflections" today when thinking about an interaction with @tehchives

I was telling him about how to change his github username in re setting up inagural WhyDRS discussion post

It made me want to do a pros/cons list for the choice (which I normally do no paper)

## don't get it?

Basically I want to start doing mciro's in the same style as what will eventually be full reflection days

Since tyou can't read my mind:

- I will start doing relfection days on github like this
- the reflrection days will happen:
1. on my laptop
2. with airplane mode
3. only offline note editror
- the reflection days:
1. will no be edditedfor typos
2. shall reserble a stream of consciousness
3. basiccally the smae as on paper but faster and different organizational style since you can't really draw thigns

I'm good with that last tradeoff be/c i realized that I'm not really an artist in teh artsy form, and I'm trying ro narrow in my on specializations laters

## readability suchks?

Yeah, I don't really go backa to reflection days unless I explictly need t ocopy an idea for wirtting soemthign

They're really more for my own selfishness, byu I realized that they could be material public information in some whay or another last time in the WhyDRS/ impact section

nyway, i think it's jsut best if I do it like this in case someone wants to earn more about how i was thinking in a point in time

## time smapshot

REcently, ive been realizing that its important to hinda hurry my ass up since the sthings were buildign really matter to a lot of peopel

more on this but not time rn

anyway thinking this can be a good wya to put down stuff with referncabliltiy before i forget them (a lot of my past reflection days are in my hard journals or papers that ultiamtely got lost)

# On micromanaging

Basically the choice was wheterh or not to mesg chives a pscreenshot on how to change his github username

He responded to my initial message thinking that it was a good itdea to change

Then i had a choive to make

## Option 1
Let him figure it out yaya

easy kinda thing to google

feels fairly automomous yay

## Option 2

what djsiaod
send him the screenshot on how to do it and a link to the github settings page

react to his msgs with emojis

idk exmeplify it 

## Pro/Con
this is the main oart where i;; normally dop it on paper

also no im not doing a real table 

too imablanced since one side prob way bigger

$$$
### pros
- easier for him to learn how do

### cons
- kinda like tmi if here's already gonna do it
- sort of could seem like reachign out to tell hi what to do
-   don't want to liike klike im telling him what to do
- takes up my time which im suposed to be using writing that drs post
- distracts me from writing the drs post
-   maybe i jsut have writers block AGggghh
- but that's prob bs, just distrcacting myself with this really
- 



anyway, i don't thin k this is super useful , and it will probably hurt my credability / reputation in that raw, unfiltered reflections like these are easy to critizie - esop if there is a super small quoite or typoe taken out of ocntext

its' a risk im willling to tkae because the alternative - me keeping everythign secret and to myself,...- i just dont think it's good policy

Out of time but yeah deficded to in an effort to help further, but i really want to leave these kinds of implementation choices to other people in the ethos of decentralization
