# Back to Conceptual Control

Today I was a bit harsh to someone via a relatively uncontextualized report, and I really shouldn’t have been. It's a valuable community member (in a good way) who's out there searching for the best solution to a materially challenging problem. It was relatively clear from prior observations of this individual’s thoughts that they weren’t a super-expert in this particular field, but they were certainly trying their best to advance the conversation.

This relatively parallels my experiences with Tomer, whom I understand other community members have conflicting opinions on regarding visionary views. Since they have an established position in the community, it was initially challenging for me to speak out against them on the protocol 20 update bug. But when the community sided with me, and we made the right choice to fix it before launch—it was a really nice validation that one central actor cannot and does not control real blockchain networks.

Unfortunately, I see myself attaining that level of reputation throughout the ownership community, which materially implies an increasing burden in considering my voice and its power. Specifically, it seems like[^n] people listen to what I say. Indeed, I’m excited to continue expanding collaborative development efforts, and this very clearly requires that I take more caution in my approaches with others to better acknowledge, appreciate, and (to a degree) reaffirm their perspectives for goodwill before jumping into business speak.

[^n]: Finally, Jesus, it took quite some time[^l]
[^l]: Please forgive the religious syntax around these reflections—it’s just how I feel.
