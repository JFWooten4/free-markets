# Emojis as Light Responses

Light touches can have a nuanced impact when gently guiding behavior towards your preferred outcome. This, of course, requires that you have a material goal in mind towards which you can shape actions. However, there is a fine line between telling someone what to do and providing advice.

Generally, I try to share as much specific, relevant, and parallel context as possible through thorough comments responding to others' actions. This is helpful (at least by my interpretations of others' responses) when the topic at hand is something I have experience in. If it's a little out of my wheelhouse but I have developed some relevant principles, then I will disclaim that technical difference before sharing what I think can help based on experience.

But there is a third option for collaboration where you (i) have no relevant expertise and (ii) can't think of sharable expertise. In these situations, the only thing left to do is praise what's been done, and by all means, specific praise ought to be shared when due. Of course, this requires that you have followed the specific development in question and have the time to dive into specific changes.[^new]

[^new]: I find myself going through this extra work when "indoctrinating" new members into the community. I really don't like that word, but it's the only one I can think of for compassionately welcoming someone into a group in a slow enough manner that you're not forcing them into action, overwhelming them with details, or shattering the reasons they began interacting in the first place. For any meaningfully complex project, there is naturally a lot of knowledge which could take quite some time to learn, so I believe it's important to strategize around how new members view the mission upon first impression.

## A New Feedback Mechanism

This leaves us in a bind if the most you can do is make some quick judgments off bona fide titles or summaries of actions, as is common in GitHub. Often, I still want to be helpful to the contributor or friend and such, but a more comprehensive reply just isn't going to happen. As I understand it, this is particularly common in the social media space.

I was thinking quite deeply about existing reaction systems on these sites earlier this morning. Namely, I have seen stark differences in multi-generational participation in conversations, especially regarding reactions. As an aside, the underlying comment responses seem more determined by venue culture, audience, and publicity.

It seems important to me because I've [successfully used](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/pull/1044#issuecomment-2455725608) emoji reactions as a way to cast votes, and I've seen so abundantly in the posting context how they can help share sentiment. Indeed, a ðŸ¤” reaction or even question marks and the like can sincerely compel someone to expand on their existing thoughts. However, it doesn't look like some of the older/more experienced folks understand all this yet, despite me seeing it work just as well with them, albeit in the sense of me being the only one using emojis and looking like a millennial and such.

All this to say that emojis have immense power for a number of reasons, especially in the reaction case. I believe this is a prime application of emojis because they are really stellar at capturing emotion (duh), which is so crucially present upon your first reaction to something. Without reacting to someone's work, I feel you're "stealing" that valuable interpersonal feedback which could otherwise help them understand how their work is landing with the community and everyone's views.

## Ongoing Alignment and Understanding Assistance

I remember when YouTube disabled the dislike button count around the same time I was learning about the importance of positive reinforcement and emotions over the so dastardly alternative. Indeed, that education, which is public on my channel, has so deeply shaped my approach to writing with choice diction promoting abundance. And, in the context of a centralized video hosting platform, it makes sense that the Google executives decided they would get better creator engagement if they (uploaders) only received positive feedback.

But in the context of other more contextual emoji-based reaction schemas, I find the binary like/dislike optionality quite meaningfully limited. Indeed, even and perhaps exemplarily, the comments on most videos follow the same general internet trolling trend, which has so very directly afflicted, to great disdain, people whom I really care about. That said, perhaps many of these challenges could be solved with expressive emoji reactions (to their [fullest extent](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/69934#discussioncomment-11055892)).

But with emojis, it's really simple to understand exactly how your piece has landed without diving into personal criticisms about nuances that might be outside of your control, as is often the case in "amateur" videos. Rather than guessing at why people liked your content, you can fully understand in a few seconds their emotional response (assuming they use sufficiently specific emojis). By specific emoji, I mean some kind of image with other emotions attached to it, which traditionally might pop that one into your mind as the perfect encapsulation of your feelings.[^disc]

[^disc]: Admittedly, it might take some time to develop your "repertoire" of the more "advanced" emojis. But I think practice helps and can only be reinforced by seeing others use them well, introducing a sort of network effect on their impact. And of course, the search bar so common in emoji selection windows can make it simple to search for how you're feeling (depending on the exact configuration).[^confs]

[^confs]: E.g., I know many common Ubuntu clients have different and relatively limited search associations for emojis than, e.g., Apple's fairly comprehensive native tool. _See also_ Discord's unique implementation of user-generated custom emojis, which can help to give you even more options for reactions and a bit of flair. These introduce another level of emoji use as a means of spreading awareness of different communities through cross-server reactions, especially in conversations which might be later referenced and observed by many more people.

Even just a basic positive reaction can sincerely help motivate others to continue, and anything with sizeability behind it could do more than that. Indeed, it is the "social capital" of likes and views which drive, dare I say, billions of people to upload online so feverishly their reaction-inducing content. What if we could apply all these creative energies to real work?

## Generational Differences Throughout Externalities

Firstly, positive reinforcement is a huge social benefit that should be promoted everywhere, whether in opaque central organizations or public community developments. That said, I'd like to dive into the limited viewpoint I have regarding their application in older generations, particularly those who might not be habituated to emojis. Without that knowledge, it's tough to expect people will extend to live-chat reactions (and that's assuming all business isn't conducted through email!).

Perhaps the most meaningful comparison here is the use of emoji reactions on certain central platforms that cost money. Some systems share this revenue with the content creator posting the source in question, whereas others choose to internalize all funds in one way or another. Notwithstanding these differences in implementation, there are large numbers of people who actively spend their money to buy reactions that receive and give special attention.

They receive special attention in the sense that you can generally see directly who (via username) spent money to provide this reaction (and sometimes how much they spent). This can be a sort of online flexing activity depending on how you look at it, although I've personally never seen it obviously used as such in a selfish "look at my marketing" example. By and large, these tools are used to show _extreme_ support for the specific piece of content (and by extension its creator) in its public setting.[^pubs]

[^pubs]: From a revenue-generation standpoint, the public aspect of these works is material since, the more eyeballs on a post, the higher the chance of total emoji reactions, including these special super reactions. The parallel to traditional industry would be a bonus or public commendation of specific work. However, the challenge here becomes a significant delay between publication and (monetary) response. This lengthens feedback loops, which I understand to be inversely proportional to innovation.

Might we agree that there's a major understanding difference here, given that younger generations with more time on their hands will _pay_ to react with a specific emoji? Ideally, this will be slowly achieved over time through more responsive professional tools that make it easy for a few forward thinkers to introduce emojis into their firms in a system that makes that behavior easier to replicate, thereby promoting transparent sentiments. Indeed, I believe wholeheartedly that this single addition to an organization's de facto standard could develop deeper meaningful conversations at the minimum and better topical assignments when applied to work items.[^contr]

[^contr]: It just seems so ludicrous to me that the existing youth grow up learning through their online environment the use of these reaction tools, but then they enter a workforce relatively abstained from any professional application thereto. Might something people will _pay_ for in the elementary context have meaningful value in clarifying ongoing material sentiments? I think it's a silly waste to defer towards communication systems that do not offer this crucial project feedback and motivation option.[^reaacs]

[^reaacs]: Consider, e.g., the response to your work with fifteen different emojis by, say, 20 people. If you're only announcing or adding a single item, then this could materially guide you towards more similar work. Knowing how important your efforts are to others might traditionally be linked only explicitly to monetary rewards, but I believe so fervently that these social donations encompass a vast untapped pool of influence, inspiration, and innovation (in the private sector at a minimum, where your job title and political status may have other societal benefits in due respect and courses of action related).

## Asynchronous Reinforcement and Social Proof

One of the most inspirational things about emojis for me is that they effectively always provide retroactive insights which are not explicitly alerted to a technology's users. That means you don't need to acknowledge or respond (internally or through work actions) to this new form of feedback until _you decide_ to peer into the associated activity. Thus, it is only at the most impactful moment when looking intentionally for peer sentiments that they are documented through reactions.

Sometimes, the timeframe for how quickly people react can have social meaning. For instance, a web chat that instantly received five ðŸ”¥ reactions after posting would mean more to me personally than the same response ten days later. But the more I think about this particular nuance, the more I see it as a function of organizational size rather than actual sentiment (given that no reaction is a form of passive deference to the norm, as is commonly understood through voting abstention).[^lws]

[^lws]: I've had the good fortune of working primarily in communities which generally consist of people under 40. Accordingly, the use of emojis has been relatively common for reactions, and indeed they are by and large immediately given when warranted. That said, a relatively low number of reactions tends to correlate exclusively with the number of members in such communities, as the only factors impacting your "emoji-reaction rate" are the content's "reaction conversion rate" and the number of people able to be "converted" to respond (all other factors relatively normalized in my head).

Social proof matters not only to others but also to oneself. I've felt firsthand the agonizing pain of screaming into the void for years with little to no reaction, as is so often the case when dealing with (i) complex public policy or centralized bureaucracies or (ii) generally complex work which might even require years of education to meaningfully understand, much less form an opinion for response. Even if I were paid a stipend through some institution for this work, I'd still tailor developments based on individuals' reactions rather than a dogmatic centralized policy decree.

## Added External Reference Context

Moreover, the original vision of the internet, so well encapsulated in early PageRank developments, centered around referrals. As in academic work, the impact of your contributions can be easily told through citations. However, as we've established, citations can take years to propagate, drastically slowing down the innovator's feedback cycle.[^edu]

[^edu]: Accordingly, emojis are stellar reaction tools across this working field, too. It's my interpretation that the lack of their implementation in effectively any academic work leads the field towards terse and stern authoritative deference (and more meaningfully dry conversation). While this might be fine in the strictly limited sense of traditional long-form peer review, I posit that it precludes new researchers from getting a "foot in the door" with their work, as was so common before 1971 when apprenticeships flourished in a more open manner.

Might it be beneficial for your work to live past your relatively short lifespan, assuming you make something worth referencing, building on, or otherwise developing? If we agree this is the case, then traditional accolades in live human interactions will not adequately inform the next generation about the significance of your work. Sure, you can have some famous theory named after you that gets forced into textbooks and down to students, but what if there were an authoritative archive of Einstein's publications that tracked how many people responded to _Relativity_ itself with ðŸ¤¯?

I take much more seriously old online posts with extensive emoji reactions than, say, a roughly formatted static HTML webpage without an author. Assuming we want more innovators, it will become increasingly challenging to keep in our shared social lexicon the names of those who are experts in their respective fields. Accordingly, might generous emoji reactions help someone first viewing content roughly comprehend its significance to those who understand enough to feel emotional resonation?

## Closing Thoughts

Ultimately, emojis are more than just a fun tool; they represent a critical avenue for meaningful feedback, especially in an age where rapid communication and asynchronous collaboration dominate. From motivating contributors in open-source projects to encouraging creativity in academic or professional settings, emojis can serve as a bridge between understanding and expression.

By adopting these tools more widely across generational and organizational boundaries, we can foster an environment that values transparency, emotional intelligence, and community support. The sooner we embrace their potential for shaping human connection and innovation, the sooner we can collectively benefit from the insights and motivations they inspire.

If we imagine a world where emojis are part of standard professional and academic communication, itâ€™s easy to see how they could transform the way we interact, collaborate, and innovate. So, letâ€™s not leave this expressive power untappedâ€”letâ€™s put it to work where it matters most.
