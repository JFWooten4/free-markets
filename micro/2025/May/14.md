# Keep Going!

Wow, guess the month of April flew right by! Sometimes the deeper thoughts here get pushed back as work deadlines pile up. Never a fan of hard centralized deadlines, but they certainly keep me up when the world says it counts.

I was originally going to do a much longer post, and hopefully soon I will have the time to purge through this backlog and formalize a lot of these ideas. I only have three pressing things to finish in my agenda before I've done everything I can alone. And it's relatively clear now that the projects need to grow imminently through combined efforts far exceeding my technical expertise.

Luckily I think everything is set up. I'm excited for everyone to finally reach the same page—whether they know it yet or not. Much of this "pioneering" work boils down to finding something meaningful and then grinding on it for what feels like forever.

It's really just the edge of something inevitable, and your actions help bring that future forward to the now. I remember setting my goal all those years back, and those thoughts ring truer than ever. Something along the lines of: you can have anything you want, and once you decide, it's all on you to bear the price—so make it worth it!
