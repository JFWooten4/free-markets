#  Keep GOing!@

WEow ,  guess  the  month  of  April  frew  right b y!  SOmetimes  hte  deeper  thoughts here get pushed  back as work deadlines pile up.  Never  a  fan of  hard  centralized  deadlines,    but  they certainly   keep me up when the world says it counts.

i  was  orgially  going to  do  a  much longer post, and hopefulyl soon  I will have the time to  purge through this backglog and  fomralize a lot of  these ideas.  I only  have three pressing things  tro finish in my agenda before I've done everythign  i can alone. ANd i t's relativelty clear  now that  the prjects need to  grow  immmennetly through combined efforts  far exceeding my technicla expertise.

Luckily  I think theveything is set up.  I'm excited for everyone to fially  reach  the samer  page—whether they knnow i t yet or not.  Much of  this  "pioneering"P work boils down  to finding something meaningufl and then  grindning on it for what feels like forever.

It's really  ust the  edge of something invevitable,  and  your  hactions help bring that  future forward to  the n ow. I remmeebr setting  my goal all those years back, and thoughts then ring truer than ever. Somethign along the lines o f: you  can have anyhting  you  want, and once  you  decide it's all on you to bear the   price—so make  it worth it!
