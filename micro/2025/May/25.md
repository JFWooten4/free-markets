# Next Working Goals

Now that TAR1's done, I see my role at every organization materially changing. I'm only a couple weeks away from finishing the DEX documentation, which will be the last material nonspecialized thing I ought to need to complete. Something about this time period brings me back to the bull run we started at the end of last year.

Pretty much everyone could draw a straight line from the discussion (however unexpected) from Tino and Tasset acquisitions. While this was explicitly not my intent, and I even was apologizing to Chives mid-convo in DMs, nonetheless it showed me something important. I'm an asset manager, and asset managers determine their value and worth based on markets.

The performance showcased here was exceptional on a plethora of scales. While I might not have profited a penny (in realized gains), and actually likely shot myself in the foot with the politicking trade (damn that sucked), I got a couple great stories out of it all. Tomer might not get it yet, but that reply to their post will come in great light.

Well here I am after four years of seriously starting this stuff. It's pretty clear we're right on the precipice of a manufactured crisis. And now I'd like to contemplate what I want to get out of it allâ€”can't waste a good catastrophe!

## Fuck Wall Street

Like, with a capital F. God I just can't believe what's been constructed around this institution to promote totalitarianism. Oh my god, if I knew how deep this rabbit hole went when I started it all those years back...

I want to rid the world of their lies once and for all. And damn I just can't think of a better setup than we have right here and now to do it together. These motherfuckers have zero goddamn clue what's coming their way, even if they read.

The question for me is how to bring all this about given the post-collapse de facto mentality of free markets. The meaningful yet underappreciated concept of organizational products and services without "higher" controlling interest. A large part of me thinks: what would Ford do before Dodge Bros if he knew about commercial paper?

## Synchronizing Massive Efforts

The context for TAR2 next year will take thousands of people working in unison. Once the world realizes that the game is up, there'll be absolute panic as we careen towards DTCC DA horseshit. We need a flawless shot into their heart.

The world wants to help. The bureaucracies? Maybe not so much. But people, individuals, and warriors want to brave frontiers.

My next task is organizing compensation. It's fulfilling my original vision for a "bonus board" without the central bureaucratic committee of yesteryear's technology. And FUCK that sounds like the most exciting thing possible ever.

## Neural Quorum Governance

I don't even know if Ake realizes the significance of what BlockScience's put together. It's going to completely change the world of asset allocation, like it's fucking unbelievable. I could literally see whole nation-states running on it.

One thing that comes to mind is Peter Thiel's Stanford speech where he explains that democracy is broken and needs some sort of new technological revolution. While the majority of the public interprets this as him suggesting that an elite few in his inner circle out-control the entire population, I see it as the clear call for NQG, manifesting decades earlier. And lol I COULD NOT BELIEVE Josh Hamilton had a reference to _T&GR_ in his book!

It's a little like coordinating how to build a community park. On one extreme we have that NY asshole who levels family play areas to build parking lots. And on the other we have primatized civilizations who don't care to "disturb nature."

I'm going to start asking people for things, and we'll see what happens. I'm going to retroactively compensate them as soon as humanly possible based on my interpretation of their value. Perhaps before (or after) that, I'll additionally develop the community crowdsourced consideration mechanisms to accurately convene the community's apt interpretation.
