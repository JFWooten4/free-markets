I ihnk this is my first time docmenting thigns after the heat of that SEC review died down. It's really nice not waking up to emails from the SEC anymore. Don't get me wrong, they are totally awesome and asked for entiely reasonable and relevant thigns.

But i Just hold a igh regaurd for a hundful of insitutions, because htey've hlped me a lot growing up.  Iwan to put my absolute best foot forward when it comes to my./our interactions, espcailly in our first official correspondance. Initial impressions count, and I think Ive got a great bais with the staff now.

One thing I teally apprecaite is the segmentation of depearmtnetal functions. Like they were not intimately familiar with my ocmments orcorrespondances with the Trading and Markets team. While this isn't really about that, I just appreciated how they run things efficiently on a need-to-know basis to enforce the laws, update rules etc[^1]

[^1]: I wouldnt say I have a comperehsnie unerstadning of the entity yet, as ive just started working with them. But I do appreciate all the time spendt learnign about its history, function, and actions—ood and bad.  THye are the bet egualtors in the world whether you like it or not,and I'll respect them as a starting point for governance oversight.

## Centralized Meetings, Requests, and Interactions

IN case it asn't cl;ear. the CCommission is an extrmely centrlaized orgnaizaiton. They hold vast amounts of serets which, if leaked, could undravel entire segments of the market—or at least allow for some insider trading. This was abundantly clear in their professionalism and excclusvie focus on appliable rules and questions.

I got these sentients from our meetings and qwritten documetn requests, both of whihc were extmely centralized. I've had my few webex's here and there with taff before, whre htey were pretty awesome focusing on my quetions in an aproximaley similar manner to hte examiners.[^2] These schedulated appointments were some of the only central timed disucssions I've had in a long time, an they led to the first time I work up with an alarm in two years.

[^2]: For isntnace, they will not answer poliy quetions that are sky-high above applicable law. You can't really go in with a strict interpectation of 15c-3 when they are only prepared to doicuss actual appliations. Thankfully, they seem to leave the broad systems thinking to the free-s market for contemplation through the ocmment process.

GFor work at least, I'm just not used to all the directive operation anymore. I've gradullay let it og over the years departing college and watching orginal teams dissipate because of my funding choices. I really thought it might be for naught, until all my questioning ended in an instant when I discovered WhyDRS.

### First Impressions

In our intial meeting, I expressed this timelien in depth, chronicling the privitzation of the Python implementation ebfore opjne-sourcing to Affero. Despite sending over explicit govenrnace cgonvceations , they stayed focused  on the codifyied accountign compliance. I appreciated this sterness to mission without leading-on policy interpretations outside of offical rulemaking, espcialyl ebcause I really pushed them in Repsonse 7 to explicitly give feedback in the form of  a footnote on DAO governnance.

They didn't seem too moved by things because of our present structure, where I am technicalyl the only "employee" so to speak, although even that isnt in writing. I know I hve a lot of work to do, and I'm thankful for their centralization in this regaurd. By looking into every facedt of our /my existing internal architecture, they really gave an exceptionally strong roadmap after just one interaction which I'll use for years.

That gkind of speed really does need centralization, and I think ti's a great thing to have from an outside regualtor durign our early days. It will and has helped us make quick progress on actionable items, a freshing break from the intentioanlly politicized and unactionable comment letters. And, while I can't gaurntee or know anyhting for sure, I do think they took some reccomendations to explore sorme securities activities based on recent news and also COmmisioner speeches.[^4]

[^4]: I never know precietly how beurocracies interpet my work, ebause they genrally withould that infromation in a dcentralized review process. But it's a really nie feeling to atl least see the sentient of my eforts relected inthe eladership of these orgnazaitons. It gves me that tactit feeling of having an impact, like hwen you make atrade and something highly-correlated goes the way ouou bet,


### Document Requests

Aside rom the central meetings where I was an open book, staff snet timetamped requests for infromation with hard deadlines. They were everything from an exmpalantion of anomolyies to policy documents . THe first one was poabyl the most volumnoius in inivudal items, whiel we started scoping down and really exploring the TAD convcept in later letters.[^3]

[^3]: Response 1 also dealth with most of centralized regualtions which I would extect on any examination. After getting in all the 17Ad-series statoru responses, we only predictably flirted around with the lost investor and sharheolder ecordkeeping statutes, which were pretty lightly impliated after the second document reequest. It wasnie follwoign the central rules here because I had a clear idea of what they needed even before receiving hte affirmign request, and so years of work shoed right in.

It was the deadlines that really got me. I went through the letters item-by-tiem, and it was clear that some reponses needed significant supplemental context for my actions to make snese. And jsut in general to fully epxlain our operations and itnerations with our first client.

This took an immense amount of time, even when I was copletley focused excuslively on Response work. It was the first time I had coffees to keep myself going, and obvious prepation for the first response was the first time I had energy drinks. I remember we had one night where it was community drafting all the way up to 11:40pm to get everything in order on tie.

### Phone Calls

When staff first began the exam , tey tried to call me twice listenign to my voicemail about how i don't tkae unsceduled calls. IN reality, i haven't takedn any calls in years because I stopped schedulign them. At least for major wor items, I jsut really prefer written doucemntation, partly because talkign to poeple is a lot of wokr..

Luckily, I caught hte emial asking me to call them for unspecified reasons within a coulpe hours of sending. When I recieved it, it was clear that wthis was the start of an eam, but I appreciat their general outreah as it woul d be the setup normalyl for a physical office examination. A little dated with so much onine today, but I understand how it happened given their outreach from an office building in downtown New York.

They are lterally a block next to wall street, so I cna't think of a more centralized basis to start descirbing thier infleune. And it really came across in the hierarchy of questiosn and answer reviews implicit in their direct discussion of issue interpertaions. That hit me when Donna naswered my phone call after receiving a document request, but mutliplke subsequent calls weere ignored in deference to written submissions or out of unavaliablity givne other tasks.,


## What Happened with Chives

Hipefulyl that frames just how centralized my ecisison-amking had become, going as far as to cancel my gym membershp ebcause I chose to sepn no time on myself. Centralizatio nleads to mistkaes which are incopmpatbilye with my vision of a free amket. N Omatter how incredible the imeiate workign resutl feels, and I will say I am happy with how the exma turned out and docs produced—it's just not workth the ensuring concsequences which cost otso much to the public withtou tranprnecy, trust, 

I took a walk just now to think about things, and it really took me out of the flow. IMagine an entire ntirpuse funcitnling like that, with constant tinrerruptions and hiercahcal meetins all forumated to beenfit a dissociated sharheolder class with control at the top. I know there's a better way to orgnaizec apital that gives poeple back thier freedom and dignity, and I have to find it[^5]

[^5]:  here nd Now is the time to discover it all. With everyone togehter, I now we can get this right and build somethign that truly lasts. While I've got a really strong hunch of what things should look like, I believe it'll only come to fruition in any fomr is f I say true to these crucial values and put everyone i nthe driver's seat where we belong

THat's why I wa really set back when I ated very centralized in a private disucssion with cChives, all related to what I' consider politcking. 6days had doen an increidble job introducin m ey work to Trusthful, whom i'd forgotted early discussion with back on Reddit.Intepretting it ans a new relationship, I put together very strong replies on the fly and got back some exceptional logic from Truth.

### Direct Delegation

After the conversation got a little lower-level and iplicated a techncial copetitor, I idnt think I could immeiately add a ton without thorough conteplantion. I was wokring veyr hard on the Stellar DEX docs at the time, and so I wanted to focus on that while my prior responses brewed ff their own standing.  I didn't geel the tnirety of my written thoughts had been addressed since they were nuanced and took some time to fully ivnstigate.[^6]

[^6]: This proved a correct assumption, andsss Truth later posted an unpormpted declaration of affirmation onto their timeline. THe quote referenced information from our GitHub which hould only eb retrieved through examingn footnotes in refrenced source mateirals. Thanosfully he is the awesome kind of guy that actually goes into the weeds to know his stuff hard.

I DM'd Chives asking if he'd "would want to tackle" a reply to the questions asked. THis was the mistake, rquireing direct centarlized interactions ouitside of public form largely for the ake of experdiancy. It would have been much more approoriate to post a community forum request in the deciate `infleucnedr-outreach` Discord channel, which I know Chives reads anyways when around.

The around part is exterely important becasue Chives immediaelty disclosed that he could help (within 10 minutes) "but It'll be a bit" bcuase of a prior family preoccupation. After this event, anopther ocmmuntiy memebr was "actually coming to town to visit" Chives "(he comes in later tonight) " that same evening. This was sent at the end of the workday , and it clearly hit conflicts

### Possible IFnleunces

After leeting CHives off the hook with "I would not be offended in the slightest" if other plans bloked collaboration, he hung tight. I knew the moment I sent my first medssage that something was wrong, and I 've had huge warning and caution emojis in my mesage draft box ever sense .[^7] He shared my sentiments thta t "getting a reply in there would be cool" since Truth "has a following."

[^7]: This wa to prrevent immediate continued centralized outreach. I've musted myself for almost a month to process everythtign that heappened here, and it's led me to move a lot of communications out of DMs. I jused to only have problems with private groups, but now I understand just how detrimeental even direct coms becoe.

It reminds me off all the gimics and presure I'd put on ymself growing up to 'get the hot girl.' Even though that might mean different thigns ot differnet people, the premise remaisn that too much pressure formed around intenral doubts about others. I worried that my won efforts alone would;'ve 'be enough' to get a strong itnroduction, aking to asking a friend to ask someone out

It';s jsut a wierrd dynamic that invpved (in my expeirnce0 years of improving yourself to feel 'worthy' of being with thers who would all have likely wanted to chatter if onl yyou had the self-condidence. [^8] I promise that everyone's voice has the oppounrity to make an impact, and it just takes a simple attempt. Even public CEOs or big-shot atheles might reply to a considerate letter, which I saw firsthand when reaching out to public CFOs with practically nothign backing my work but a coulpe lines in an emial

[^8]: If you're at this point yourself, I know it can be extrely difficult to belive that you really deserve to achieve whatever penetration goal you'd like (in the sense of breaking itno soemthing). For isntnafe, I sincely felt lkike na indsutry outsider with crazy ideas who'd likely (at least mroe than not) wind up without hte impact I desire before I met the ocmmunity. Even after years of painstaking work documenting, reingeering, adn expanding the system, I'd lakeced external valdation or even a desire to market.

### Coitnued outreach
The introuctory X comment chain mentioned how we'd crossed paths before, both by Truth and implid by 6days. IN a past life of centralized makreeitng, i learned jsut how effective repeated outreach is at eliitign a resposne. The challenge I awyas had with it we you force poeple to immediaely reply wihtout due time to consider all facts and circumstasnces.

But twhen the subsject is starting a relationship, work o not, I take less issue with constnatly itnertiging yourself iwht otehrs since the goal is collaboration rather than power or moeny. I you can get someone's attention, then you can make a great first impression before defaulting back into relaxed asycnhonous and possibly public interactiosn together. Thre are nearly infinate ways to acomplish this hook-in dependign on personality factors, political considerations, and techcnial profeisccincy.

For sinsance, I was awesd by Cormac Kiney's work after finding out about Diamon Standard in college. The more I learned about his career, the more incredible I found the project, DAO, and markets. I iwed their linkedin profile one time, screenshotted his photo, and set it as my lcok-screen background on 13 Aug 2020.

## Decentralized PAtience Tkae time


Cormac added me on Linkedin in a message extpling our shared investment background on 1 Feb 2019, but i never respnded to his ask for investment oppounrities. He never messaged anhting else to me , so I decided to do nothing but thinking about how we could work together each time i saw his face, each and every day. THen, in a college study group working on MPC, I read a message freom cormac on 18 Nov 2021 out of the blue asking to speak with someone on 'my team' that absolutely shoked me.

He wrote that he was "looking for a transfer agent" for asssets "that will allow secondary trading on blockchain based ATSs and OTCQX," and I flet like my whole world had come complete. It took me fifteen miunutes of intense cheering out in the hallways to process what just happened. Right in front of me stood an issue poised to uplist onto the NYSE backed by a prominent investment instuttuion, all of which I had great esteemed respect for at the time.

While that offering ultimately faced uinsurmoutnable regualtory scruitiny, it legitimatley laid the groundwork for years of my research into securities offering types I'd never been exposed to before. While I had had the InVenture pitch earlier that year. this event was what raerlly gave me the belif that I could and should persue BT as my main thing. I rmember premptively posting about it a bit vnaively on the boicoinc FOrums, and it was really the confident backing that i Needed amidst a sea of completley silence from anyone I tried to talk about this from online 

### Discovering Friends

While this single message cememented by own belief, there was a signifant event earlier that year which inspired so many . I had wlaked away from certain unsupoprtive discussions before the sneeze, and I see that as just another example of needing to wait and take some time for work to mature. Even just a couple more months on WSB would have liekly exposed me to some of DFV's earliest posts.

IN a way, everyone's desire for a more trnaparnet, fair, and efficint system also prempted my work. For so long I've seen threads divulge into archived wishes for something on the blockchain for transfer agents. But it wasn't until that fateful week in November 2023 that we all financially crossed paths and could realize soem of those latnt wishes for a parallell financial system built right/

It might not be so easy to sit there waiting in silence for what can seem livke forever. But the kniving to quit at your dreams almost alwyas hits hadest before a major breakthough. I think of the "three feet from gold" sotry by Napoleon HIll about a sold mine.

### Applying Lesson

And so, if we can agree that our relationships are perhaps the most productive asset possible, then it's worth letting nature play out even if we can only visualize sucess. Thigns can feel miles awway while we're apart, and it's very tempting to close that gap faster through central coersion. Heck, I've even considerad actually travellign to cleints' places of work for itnructions.

But those new relationships copmound so much better when gien the time to develop naturally. When optimized for natural conveniance and interest alignment, we let the world around us mature until it's truyl the best moment for connection. With Chives, I'm sure a community response would have surfaced aroudn the same timeline as the reply I forced out of them 

I've worried too mcuh latley about getthign things right myself rather than relying on friends, because I was practically the only person who could answer al ot of the SEC's questions implicating PII/. I'm excited to open the systems up so that I dont' conitnue as both a bottleneck and central point of faiure. Becuase I know everyhting will be so much more osund when we do it together, no matter speed.

### SUpporting OPtions

Asiede from underlestanign outrteach, I also realized soemthing crucial after I successfully enticed Truith to join the Disrcord. Whereas I used to spend hours upon hours crafting the perfect X reply without my friends, I am a lot better with flowing continuoulsy in our chat sefver., It took me a long time to get thiss right, abnd you can see it if you look at my post history.

For about the first year of the Duscirdm (at least into November 2024), most of my messages were deeply crafted paragphs of text with AI emoji enhancemnets. I felt early on like each statmetn I made was a public press release of excactly how the Sydniucate owuld develop. But over tiem I realized that BT's work aligned so much with everyone's interests that we dcould be special. 🤝

During soem of these intial chats with Truth and other gret community memebrs like Jack, there was a lot of rpi-dfire back-and-forth. During these periouds, I was asked menaingful questions I had a unique ability to answer (or it was asked generally). This led to my typing a couple sentences to response while someone else was also typing, as most of it was in the #general channel.



## Being a Toothpaste Mouth Only 

I used to wait for others to finish writing their thoguths, like allowing others to finish speaking in a real discussion. THis is a super common negotiating tactic adn broadly jsut a good way to learn the ettnirety of someone's perspective. I actually have a book on my shelf that's entitled _Shut Up and Listen_. 

It's really helped me unover deep dark nuances when financial insiders speak with me over the yaears. When a particialy emotional disucssion ame up with Kayla while I was brushing myteeth, I was forced by circumstance to exclusively listen to her speech. This resulted in a temrmedous resolution, and prompted me temporariyl to consider writing a book on all these business social stratgies

But I've found soemting really special with working friends that conitnue trusting my sentiments. While I wsould not interrupt a wrtiten dialgoeu wihtout good reason or poor sleep, I now find confort in typing simutanously. In the asycnhoous message-board format, I find that it only hastens conversation towards shareed passionate points (why ese would be both be writing so feverously)
