# Willing to Let Go

I'm cleaning up a lot of old media because I work so much better with all my clutter processed. Most of my dream life involves having nothing on my hard drive because it's all organized in public references. While I still have a lot of work to do organizing GitHub work, I'm coming to an end of local files and comms, which is super relieving.

During this clean-up, I'm learning again how to let things go. I remember shredding all the paper documents I had for MonerAds after dissolving the entity. That was a real "no turning back" point for me, in that I was going to focus only on the Syndicate (and the start of deprecating trading, as it was the housing vehicle for the fund in certain brokers).

Now I'm coming to the conclusion that I need to focus on love, and that means removing old local media defined by hate. I have particularly this exceptional quickscoping banner header from Vylet, which I really love but I cannot permit to continue to exist. I have chosen to ignore the bullshit spewed by the likes of Saylor or Nadine, intentionally avoiding interaction with their content online.

Over time, I hope these feelings will fade as I cease feeding them with anger. It has likely clouded my judgment, which I certainly notice looking back over written communications from years prior which were obviously blinded. Desperation is the gateway to oblivion. 💗
