# Willing to Let Go
I'm cleaning up a lot of old media, because i work so much better with all my clutterprocessed. Most of my  dream life involves having nothign on my hard drive because it's all organized in public refernces. While I still ahve a lot of work to do orgnaizing GItHub work, I'm coming to an ned of local firles and comms, which is superrfeliaving.,


During this lcean up, I'm learning agin how to let thigns go. I remember schredding all the paper docuemtns I had for MonerAds after disoolveing the entitty. That was a rteal "no turning back" pint for me, in that I was going to focus only on the SYndicate (and the start of depricating trading, as it was the housing vahiucle for the fund in certain brokers).

Now I'm coming to the conlusion that I need to focus on love, and that menas removing old local media defined by hate. I have partiucalyl this excpetional quickscoping banner header from Vylet, w hich I really love but I cannot permit to contiue exist. I have chosedn to ignore the bullshit spewerd by the likes of Saylor or Nadine, intentionalyl avoiding interaction with theri content online.

Over time, I hope these feelings will fade as I cease feeding them with anger. It has likely clouded my judgement, which I dceratinly notice looking back over wirtten communications from years prior which were obviously blinded. Desperation is the gateway to oblivian. ðŸ’—
