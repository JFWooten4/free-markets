# Not a Trader Anymore

Three years ago, I got my Galaxy Fold 3 phone off a Facebook marketplace post while visiting my Dad in FLorida.[^a] I was so excited because I knew I awas about to enter sone big trades, and this was just the device i needed.[^b] Briefly, my Dad wanted me to go on a trip across Euopre after I graduated, and a tablet in my hand meant I could keep up with the tradingView app.

Since I haven't written about it before, it was a nice trip. I had an adventure finding the _absolute_ cheapest places I could stay along the route through AirBo (mostnly).[^c] With only an eSim to keep me connected to the markets on the go, this phone meant everything as my chief link to trading.

A couple months after I got it,  I was finishing up my last semester, where I commuted daily on my skateboard. The Fold was open, playing a video while I tinkered with my wheels at thome. Thats when this simple m miantnence turning into a heartbrekaign nightmare.

Adrwe unscrewing one of the weekls, it fell out of my grip and off hte miniture table I'd propped the board on. And it fell smack-dab in the middle of the delicate intetior screen. A giant vertical green line immediately appreared nad the whole display had smaller vertical lines colored throughout.

I remmebr bawling my eyes out for what felt like hours. I was on the ground alone, sobbing endlessly over this dmage. It felt like a gaping whole opened inside my heart.

## The Hole

I rmemeber writing about this hole before. I think it has happered in Macro days and the gratitude journela. I really can't tell if it's greed, pride, or something else .

The reason I was so distraught had nothing to do with implicated repair costs. When I looked at that splintered screen, I saw everything I'd ever cared about torn away.[^d] The reality of a three-month trip without trading hit me like a brick wall.

For the first time, I realized that I'd be awya from my full setup for practically ages.[^e] Sure, I could monitor the BTC trade by that time and minimally explore other setups, ut it'd be a copeltley different pace than the comprehensiveness I aws used to.relishing. For hte first time ever, I felt likeI couldn't be a trader, and it made me want to explode inside.





[^a]: He didn't live there, but man we had an aswesome lobster trip together. I've got ot organize all myold pictures into a self-hosted repo . Practically everything there can be public, and I think it'd compliment the gratidue journal well in due time.

[^b]: As for the former trading context, this was briefly before the material Bitcoin trade principally disclosed in SEC comments. While I was setting everything up on my full trading desktop (8+ monitors), I knew the drawdown would take about eight months. To confidelyntly reach my rpofit target, it would take continued efforts into 2022.

[^c]: Some townes were quite remote and neccesitated a bidget hotel. For others, I epxlored backpacker sites for couchsurfing given abudnant populations. And I suppose some nights I dozed off in a traincar :)

[^d]: Okay, "worked toward" might be a better verbage here, but even then I'd put in so much effort ot the Syndicate by then. It's just that I love makets so mcuh, and they've lawyas been the backbone of all my experiences. I idstinctly remember immence dissapointment when some mid-day romance swept me away form a sick forex trade

[^e]: The mass of emtion flooding my memorieshere blurs te surge of recollection, but the more I think about it, the more I remember hving a chart up when the hweel hit. In any case, I wonder what life would be like withou that coerced venture, a term I might apply more broadly to all of college after meeting Abrahim. Nothing cna change now, bit I certainlyl remember different efeelings about professional trading before nd after that whole hiatus where my connection with marets practically faced a complete bone-dry fragmentation of focal activities
