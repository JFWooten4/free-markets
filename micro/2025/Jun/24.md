# Not a Trader Anymore

Three years ago, I got my Galaxy Fold 3 phone off a Facebook marketplace post while visiting my Dad in FLorida.[^a] I was so excited because I knew I awas about to enter sone big trades, and this was just the device i needed.[^b] Briefly, my Dad wanted me to go on a trip across Euopre after I graduated, and a tablet in my hand meant I could keep up with the tradingView app.

Since I haven't written about it before, it was a nice trip. I had an adventure finding the _absolute_ cheapest places I could stay along the route through AirBo (mostnly).[^c] With only an eSim to keep me connected to the markets on the go, this phone meant everything as my chief link to trading.

A couple months after I got it,  I was finishing up my last semester, where I commuted daily on my skateboard. The Fold was open, playing a video while I tinkered with my wheels at thome. Thats when this simple m miantnence turning into a heartbrekaign nightmare.

Adrwe unscrewing one of the weekls, it fell out of my grip and off hte miniture table I'd propped the board on. And it fell smack-dab in the middle of the delicate intetior screen. A giant vertical green line immediately appreared nad the whole display had smaller vertical lines colored throughout.

I remmebr bawling my eyes out for what felt like hours. I was on the ground alone, sobbing endlessly over this dmage. It felt like a gaping whole opened inside my heart.

## The Hole

I rmemeber writing about this hole before. I think it has happered in Macro days and the gratitude journela. I really can't tell if it's greed, pride, or something else .

The reason I was so distraught had nothing to do with implicated repair costs. When I looked at that splintered screen, I saw everything I'd ever cared about torn away.[^d] The reality of a three-month trip without trading hit me like a brick wall.

For the first time, I realized that I'd be awya from my full setup for practically ages.[^e] Sure, I could monitor the BTC trade by that time and minimally explore other setups, ut it'd be a copeltley different pace than the comprehensiveness I aws used to.relishing. For hte first time ever, I felt likeI couldn't be a trader, and it made me want to explode inside.

## Kennesaw MOuntain

I made a sentimental trade when I decided to end polyphasic trading for a deference towards finding a partner. I'd seen learly the potential of that lifestyle, and it was abundantly clear that the path would lead to sizablewealth, to put it gently,. ButI just couldn't believe the world was meant to be that isolated.[^f]

I wore a small "gold" necklace during Uberman. t was my onstant rmeined to find strength in every second of every day (it _never_ came off). It also reminded me that I define the chains I want to live my life within, since all this was my free choice., [^g]

When I stopped, I took the distant and connecting route to Kennesaw mOuntain.[^h] And, after a two hour ride ad similar hike, I looked out over the Horizon form its beautiful peka. Stunned with grace and a longstaning appreciate ion for nature, I dug a small hole and buried the necklace as the sun began to set.


## Gradual Shifting

Over the years since, I've come to accept that my present roles need to be much more than trading. Most direclty, I've uncovered a deep appreciation for distributed asset managers which (while I always had) far supassed my limited early interpetaions of uineenficinetl capital allocaiton (whereby I only saw people giving their moeny to anyone _but me_). This point likely exceeds the scope of the post, but genrally it has been quite humbling to realize the vast efficincies of markets connecting billions of people through dispersed indepednent self-interest.

My actions had to diverge form trading early on if I really wanted the needed infrastrucutre built out in any timely manner.[^i] So, I supressed my desires, closed down my accounts, andh unkered down to build out TAD3. In practice this just looked like all m fnds sitting in a csavings account, which would make any money manager worth their salt vomit in disgust.

Honeslty, it wasn't awesome. Every now and then, I'd see a headline somewhere random and remember how absiluteltey creampie easy it owuld've been to make a quick banker on ^VIX options. It
s jsut something I deeply believe shoudl be done well, and to live up to that standard would personally necessitate unliateral commitmment.[^j]

## Next Step

These last months, I've stopped reciting the seven billion part of my T&GR objective. I don't know if it s the stress, magnitude, or soemthing else; but I haven't felt the need to harp so much on the monetary side, an act which brings momentary pleasure but really isn't on the mark of immediate efforts. And I dropped the dealine long ago for centralization concerns raised in the last Macro.[^k]

Itwas orignally framed aroun managin assets for everyone on the planet, but I no understnad that is naive and baseless perrogative compared to the localized power of all wokring in unison. And now I see so clearly this fuutre eocnomic reality where Stellar becomes the world's shared infrastructure, with lumens as the common peoples' medium. The native inflation is so genius becuase it's preciselt the lower-eschelons who can finally benefit from inflation through pioneering governance in precilesly the opposite way of the cantillionaire effect so egrariouos.

These last wo weeks, I've had perfect trades in my hand. Trades which easily turned a few grand into the six fgures. But I was so caught inup in the SEC exmaination that I learned big.

### Different Person

IN hinking about htese positions under intense scruitin,y[^l] IO've come to realize that I'e changed. I'm thinking about more than PNL becuase there's finally much more at stake than money. The Sydnicate work and particualry SEC attention have brought me to understand that practicably the future of U.S. market structure could rest on my reputation 

I really hope that's nt the case, and I dont take it lightly that I even consider that a possability. But there's just nobody welse who'se done this. ANd i can't let makrets forever discourge the TAD concept because I fucked up a Congressinoal etstimony as "the face" of something so much bigger than me.

nd even on a working basis, it's been years since i've been fully immersed in real trading. It's all been this systems thinking and typed work-products which differ starkly from buy/sells. Don;t get me wrong, it'sb ene marvalous work with inspiring perople, but again it's just really different from sitting alone in a room 20 hours a day and examining the markets.

### Different World

As to the last point, there's a particular difference that's emmerged ovr the years in my interpretaiton of public (or really any) centralized copanies. In fleshing out the currenyc reform ideas, I've come to the interpretation that it might not actually be the best use of my time to pcik who will be a "winner" or "loser" in strictly entity instances. If I were to say, wany to convice the world to use gold bullion coins for everything, then it's a little irrelevant how well I can muliplty my own share of the metal through investments in productive assets.

I'm much morefascinated by society-wide nonprofit changes which go eyond the early level of asset management seen in competing money managers. in words my contituents would use, it's just more interesting work which intellectually stimulates me in a way not seen by trading anymore. I even remarked recently to smoene who kindly offered to have me manage their welath[^m] that everything was just too easy.

Preficatbility like this only comes from centralization. There's never amenas of guessing who the inventor will be out of a crowd of pre-scoohoolers. And I don't want a centralized society.

### Regulatory Candor

Becuase trading is so depeply in  my blood, it's challenging to undwind my thoughts on certain financial assets from my work-products. For isntnace, I've been delaying the 723 PR for a year now because I know I'll receive more consideration in terms of nominal virtual currency if I wait for the rpcie to go back down to the publicly-shared support lelvel. And even that tweet of a price chart really blurs the lien between bondafide professional accounting and degen trader thappiness.

To put it more clearly, take for instance the BTC trade referenced earlier. In the TAR1 comment letter, I epxlicitly lay out fo th COmission that Wall Street will collapse the pice of BTC to bankupt Cede. Later discussion in the WhyDRS discord affirmed this sentiment though an exmplicit public endorsement of an immeninet collapse. ,  . 

Thus, if I make the trade, now it really starts looking like I'm trying to maniupulate the market. One conversation which comes to mind was just before the great finanical crisis. Peter Schiff was on stage in fornt of all the dickheads explainign to them that everythign was about to copleltey kerplink itself.

One thing I learend growing up was that I can't tell "two versions of the truth/." I jsut find it mimmensely difficult to share anything other than the direct primary sources whcih definetinatlvely sestbalish a chain of facts. And from that bassi I clarify my opinions.

### Confident Action

Teh hcanllegne comes hwen taking decisive action which , in a relatively centralized manner, requires certain due haste. Under the burden of insane centralized deadlines these last months, I'veocme to find that I can and will leave nonmaterial things out when pushcomes to shove/. And there is no amount of money I'd pay to be allowed to voice my full opinions.

Years ago, I considered buying a sidearm. Before then, I was fascinated with the idea of a biulletproof t-shirt. I've always thought "they" would come for me because of our work.

But I realived this consant parania just wans't healthy.[^n] And now I have the same feeling regarding the "conflict f interest: charges pegged aganst Schiff when actively making perhaps one of the few legendary trades that collapse insurance assholes. It's just not worth living these two lives where I Need to think about whether or not my work presents finacnial advice.

Accordingly, I'm taking a page out of my years past and climbing a nearby moutain to bury the FTX sungrlasses I got at Bitcoin 2022. I can't think of a more fitting centralized "finance bro" artifact so conspicuously implicated in immediate conflicts of interest. While I;ve thought about digging up those chains, I'll never come back for this fraud booger.


[^a]: He didn't live there, but man we had an aswesome lobster trip together. I've got ot organize all myold pictures into a self-hosted repo . Practically everything there can be public, and I think it'd compliment the gratidue journal well in due time.

[^b]: As for the former trading context, this was briefly before the material Bitcoin trade principally disclosed in SEC comments. While I was setting everything up on my full trading desktop (8+ monitors), I knew the drawdown would take about eight months. To confidelyntly reach my rpofit target, it would take continued efforts into 2022.

[^c]: Some townes were quite remote and neccesitated a bidget hotel. For others, I epxlored backpacker sites for couchsurfing given abudnant populations. And I suppose some nights I dozed off in a traincar :)

[^d]: Okay, "worked toward" might be a better verbage here, but even then I'd put in so much effort ot the Syndicate by then. It's just that I love makets so mcuh, and they've lawyas been the backbone of all my experiences. I idstinctly remember immence dissapointment when some mid-day romance swept me away form a sick forex trade

[^e]: The mass of emtion flooding my memorieshere blurs te surge of recollection, but the more I think about it, the more I remember hving a chart up when the hweel hit. In any case, I wonder what life would be like withou that coerced venture, a term I might apply more broadly to all of college after meeting Abrahim. Nothing cna change now, bit I certainlyl remember different efeelings about professional trading before nd after that whole hiatus where my connection with marets practically faced a complete bone-dry fragmentation of focal activities

[^f]: I've discused this loniess in the AStrella application from my `notes` repo, earlier this year. It was largely this fctor combined with the inability to comprehsnively trade during inter-broker weekend futures windows whcih really ticked me off. And the poison pill on top of the crap was the abhorrent broker commissions.

[^g]: Briefly, i was not hindrered by any material ecnomic needs while under the collegiate care of my parents. The best thing about it was they helped wiht my grocery bills, which routinely excieeded $500/month on top of a full meal plan (just to keep up with the (keto) energy demands. I had some real fule pumping through me back then, and I really appreciate their assitance even though I theoretically had the capital to handle things myself.

[^h]: While I;ve been there a ton, hiked the whole thing, and even ran it with some firends; this was one of the only times I bussed out there. I remmebr cheating by taking  the road up with Kayla once, and she was so freaked out the hwole time. Lol for me but great deference towards cautionus driving (and not hiking) for her, ideally with gaurd rails.

[^i]: I had my supposed strategy of jsut becoming a multi-millioniare and hriing everyone early on, which frankly is one of many other avenues that could;ve worked. But I saw the deep repugnant lesions implicated by DTC's ovwership structure those firs tfew months back. it was jsut so very clear to me that I had to hold strong on a different smarter approach.

[^j]: I realize this might seem contracdictry to psat publications, espcially _Nine to Noon_, pomoting a three hour trading day. Admittedly, this sort of day-trading only excited because of the articilar contrasitns legacy Wall Street imposes on the exchange of assets . Northistnaidng, a keyp oint iwhtin the textis that you can take a break while not wokring, devoting your total professional mental benadwith to trading, something I believe is deeply necessary to propely manage assets as an individual not ensnared in the broercracies of central sales-custodians

[^k]: As an side, I'd really like to bring the OCMmission into this sense of trustful peace established wihtout expliit working deadlines. It's really just an incredible at-home feeling to know that things are going as fast as they can. The world just works etter when we aren't all yelling at hte proverbial chef to fry the egg faster (a process they can't really control,

[^l]: For instnc,e there was a braindead short BTC off  a hammer reversal on the dialy, and it was clear from the four-hour that the turnaround started. I had what I thoguht was ust under two hours to make a cll, which really turned out to be roguht around 44 minutes (lol insittutions don't have the same pressure valves upward). In this condensed period, particularly devoid of nutrintous food, my hungry brain walked away form the trade and into the kitchen, contemplating much of the cfolloiwng complex second-order reffects around making this 

[^m]: The particular retornt as to simplicity came a day before the Iranian strike. In a visit with my Mom who came over this weekend, I remakred that there's no reason to watch the news because it's all so obviousl that XYZ is exactly what's going to happen. This foresight into the bfuture based on present eincetives makes a sick trader, but I can barely express the intent of these thoughts without ensaring myself in the centralized trap of yesteryears intermediated holding system which creates so much harm in the world I just can't write.

[^n]: Albeit with a little help from watching the first season of the Boondocls_. As an aside, I'm so glaf Kayla is a super Otaku girlie. She puts the best content in front of me.
