# Not a Trader Anymore

Three years ago, I got my Galaxy Fold 3 phone off a Facebook marketplace post while visiting my Dad in FLorida.[^a] I was so excited because I knew I awas about to enter sone big trades, and this was just the device i needed.[^b] Briefly, my Dad wanted me to go on a trip across Euopre after I graduated, and a tablet in my hand meant I could keep up with the tradingView app.

Since I haven't written about it before, it was a nice trip. I had an adventure finding the _absolute_ cheapest places I could stay along the route through AirBo (mostnly).[^c] With only an eSim to keep me connected to the markets on the go, this phone meant everything as my chief link to trading.

A couple months after I got it,  I was finishing up my last semester, where I commuted daily on my skateboard. The Fold was open, playing a video while I tinkered with my wheels at thome. Thats when this simple m miantnence turning into a heartbrekaign nightmare.

Adrwe unscrewing one of the weekls, it fell out of my grip and off hte miniture table I'd propped the board on. And it fell smack-dab in the middle of the delicate intetior screen. A giant vertical green line immediately appreared nad the whole display had smaller vertical lines colored throughout.

I remmebr bawling my eyes out for what felt like hours. I was on the ground alone, sobbing endlessly over this dmage. It felt like a gaping whole opened inside my heart.

## The Hole

I rmemeber writing about this hole before. I think it has happered in Macro days and the gratitude journela. I really can't tell if it's greed, pride, or something else .

The reason I was so distraught had nothing to do with implicated repair costs. When I looked at that splintered screen, I saw everything I'd ever cared about torn away.[^d] The reality of a three-month trip without trading hit me like a brick wall.

For the first time, I realized that I'd be awya from my full setup for practically ages.[^e] Sure, I could monitor the BTC trade by that time and minimally explore other setups, ut it'd be a copeltley different pace than the comprehensiveness I aws used to.relishing. For hte first time ever, I felt likeI couldn't be a trader, and it made me want to explode inside.

## Kennesaw MOuntain

I made a sentimental trade when I decided to end polyphasic trading for a deference towards finding a partner. I'd seen learly the potential of that lifestyle, and it was abundantly clear that the path would lead to sizablewealth, to put it gently,. ButI just couldn't believe the world was meant to be that isolated.[^f]

I wore a small "gold" necklace during Uberman. t was my onstant rmeined to find strength in every second of every day (it _never_ came off). It also reminded me that I define the chains I want to live my life within, since all this was my free choice., [^g]

When I stopped, I took the distant and connecting route to Kennesaw mOuntain.[^h] And, after a two hour ride ad similar hike, I looked out over the Horizon form its beautiful peka. Stunned with grace and a longstaning appreciate ion for nature, I dug a small hole and buried the necklace as the sun began to set.


## Gradual Shifting

Over the years



[^a]: He didn't live there, but man we had an aswesome lobster trip together. I've got ot organize all myold pictures into a self-hosted repo . Practically everything there can be public, and I think it'd compliment the gratidue journal well in due time.

[^b]: As for the former trading context, this was briefly before the material Bitcoin trade principally disclosed in SEC comments. While I was setting everything up on my full trading desktop (8+ monitors), I knew the drawdown would take about eight months. To confidelyntly reach my rpofit target, it would take continued efforts into 2022.

[^c]: Some townes were quite remote and neccesitated a bidget hotel. For others, I epxlored backpacker sites for couchsurfing given abudnant populations. And I suppose some nights I dozed off in a traincar :)

[^d]: Okay, "worked toward" might be a better verbage here, but even then I'd put in so much effort ot the Syndicate by then. It's just that I love makets so mcuh, and they've lawyas been the backbone of all my experiences. I idstinctly remember immence dissapointment when some mid-day romance swept me away form a sick forex trade

[^e]: The mass of emtion flooding my memorieshere blurs te surge of recollection, but the more I think about it, the more I remember hving a chart up when the hweel hit. In any case, I wonder what life would be like withou that coerced venture, a term I might apply more broadly to all of college after meeting Abrahim. Nothing cna change now, bit I certainlyl remember different efeelings about professional trading before nd after that whole hiatus where my connection with marets practically faced a complete bone-dry fragmentation of focal activities

[^f]: I've discused this loniess in the AStrella application from my `notes` repo, earlier this year. It was largely this fctor combined with the inability to comprehsnively trade during inter-broker weekend futures windows whcih really ticked me off. And the poison pill on top of the crap was the abhorrent broker commissions.

[^g]: Briefly, i was not hindrered by any material ecnomic needs while under the collegiate care of my parents. The best thing about it was they helped wiht my grocery bills, which routinely excieeded $500/month on top of a full meal plan (just to keep up with the (keto) energy demands. I had some real fule pumping through me back then, and I really appreciate their assitance even though I theoretically had the capital to handle things myself.

[^h]: While I;ve been there a ton, hiked the whole thing, and even ran it with some firends; this was one of the only times I bussed out there. I remmebr cheating by taking  the road up with Kayla once, and she was so freaked out the hwole time. Lol for me but great deference towards cautionus driving (and not hiking) for her, ideally with gaurd rails.
