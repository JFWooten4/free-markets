## Accepting Leadershio

Today I had a nice walk to the nearby river . It was quite a 2+ hour journey all in, and it was worth its time in gold. Just awesome to get back in nature after so mcu h head-down time.

 I was supposed to hae a reflection day today, but I wasn't gable to get TAR1 out on time. Sucks, but I'll get it going asap and _ingers crossed_ have a weekday off for it by SFA flights. Really wish I had another few to use the last couple days on my ski pass, but I guess that's just loss aversion kicking in given the insane rates they charge.

 ANyway, ~~after~~ before that reflection journeytoday, I came to peace with the ereality that Enrique will probably not get the DRS stuff anytime soon, and he certainly 100% will not get it from me. It's a shame how that relationship developed, but also a refreshing experience to see someone so technically-minded for the first time really. Never had such an extended dialect over the course of months with someone who 's definition of documentation is the source code-really cool guy.

 ### Encouraging GiHUb Work

 Chives is starting to get into the flow of PR review commets, and I think ~~they~~ he just uncovered commit comments. He's the main source of inspiration for this recfelction becuase of how I ahdneld a recent micro-directive=-prompt, which wasn't ideal. For context, the were jsut getting started with reviewings and such, so they did a PR where he added line-by-line comments int he markdown.

 I will get to that in a sec, but first i wnat tot address that Ive been using "they" over and over to refer to Chives. This relates to my defualt habitual tendancy of these last couple years to write more incluselivy, especiallywhen dealing wiht psuchnomyous contirbutors. Part of p"ermisionless" means contirbuting without barriers such as revealing your (gender) identity, leaving the work content to get judged on its meritcs. Whether or not women should be required to work because of the inflation and degredating equality of capitlism in its centralized form is another question I choose not to adress here.

 When I was walking back from the stream, I saw so clearly the contrast between a decentralized and free natural world full of beatry contrasting with the daily nothingness of centralization present at a stoplight ahead of me. I thought so deeply about this present opporuntiy to bring decentralization ethos to the "blind" following the old centralized model of life in all its quadaries. And part of that really stems around impersonal identification where I can lead a charge and leave the individualied items up for implementation by the ompounding mass of the self-incentiivizing commmunity. 

 All this to say that I've thogh a lot about introducing any for of hierarchy into effort organization, since that;s the first step towards centralization. Obviously we've hd to doa little bit with the write access to git repos, but I've tried and furthered (by removing org teams today) to keep everythign as individulizable and peer-to-peer as possible. Thus even very close relationships liek Chives, I siometimes fallback to "they" in the impersonal, general sense as my default dialect when reffering to the much larger number of individual contirbutors in their own cpaacity (rather than a collective0.[^a]

 [^a]: Admitted;y,  you do lose the specificiy of he/she pronouns when opting for the "they" generalization, which is mich more pronounced in languiages like spanish where the former diction would be incorrect syntax. Kind of sucks, but also makes me wonder about what it means to be an individual in teh first palce. Can any of us really claim to be independent selves when so much of our vierwpoint stems from our unique worldviews with millions (if not more) decentralizaed points of localized influence?

 ## The Mistake

 My error was in a response after DMing Chives in gratitude for some notes thaey added where I had a note to myself that i needed sources for citation. Chives kindly added those sources! So i thanked them in a DM when I came across it secondarily, as my first pass thorugh I was completely enamoured by the style of citatied refernce rather than the object of form.

 Chives is alwyas so fast on the replies, which somethimes gives me pauise ot message over silly small things liek that. But I figured in the moment it was just such an exceptional contribtioin that showed them[^2aaa] going bove and beyond gain.[^aaa] My inital responsewas to ðŸ’œ his reply.

 [^2aaa]: THere I go again with the nongendered pronouns. I think another sizabel part of it is that his profile picture is Kirby with a beer, but the beer isn't even that colorarily distinctive so the masculine association traditonally inehrit completley fades oneme. I asked them whether htey p[refer Chives or Chirsptoihjer (public first name information associated with WhyDRS docs), and they  stuck with the psudonmy. Love that people have the cjoice to be a follower in the strictly genderized submissive sense of certain workign contexts by choosing not to associate their porofile with a legitimate identity, but that's also a very personal choice with many tangible implications depednent on so so many decntralized factors often far out of one's cotrol.

 [^aaa]: CHives has been such an  ncreidbly innovative adopter of Github as someone completely unfamiliar with the platform before hand. And of course they've been putting in immesurable amoutns of work by public analssi for years and years. But damn it , I don't care how established oyou are, there;'s never enough quality praise on meaningful work items! I want more poeple giving compliments as general comments on my and everyone elses' PRs just as a mnanner of commune/.

 But then I added in a written repsonse saying "I could never have found these sources" because I am not a GME expert like thme or some horeshit. It was food in the sendse of a self=depricating whip meant to inflate ther receipient's ago, which would havebeen mroe peapprote in a conversation with someone I'm less familiar with like Enriqeu (although I doubt they'd care one millimeter). It just felt wrong bringing it up there, sort of like the feeling I got DMing Limegreen about my GitHub Sponsors profile in re economics chat.
